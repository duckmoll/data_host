UNIVERSITY OF DAYTON,"CARBON CARBON ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",2020-10-27,537364.96,"The U.S. Air Force and other Government agencies are developing hypersonic vehicles for a wide range of critical missions. Durable high temperature material systems are needed which can be utilized as hot structures or as key structures in thermal management approaches which can effectively distribute thermal energy associated with hypersonic flight. Carbon/Carbon (C/C) composites are one material system of interest for use in hot (up to 2800¬∞ F (1538¬∞ C)) structural, thermal management and aerodynamic applications. C/C laminates and sub-elements are required for the development and/or advancement of NDI techniques; utilization of analytical methods for manufacturing process assessments; use of optical diagnostics for improved material manufacturing process control; and, investigation of aero/material interactions.
 
 
 The objective of this task is to fabricate test panels, specimens, access to manufacturing capabilities for assessment of analytical methods and optical diagnostics for process control, and provide subject matter expertise (SME) throughout this program"

 The objective of this task is to fabricate test panels, specimens, access to manufacturing capabilities for assessment of analytical methods and optical diagnostics for process control, and provide subject matter expertise (SME) throughout this program
 
 SCOPE OF WORK
 
 The scope of work of this task includes all planning, execution, implementation, and fabrication of C/C composite panels, sub-elements, and NDI calibration specimens. UDRI will provide C-CAT with stitched composite preforms for processing in to C/C composites. C-CAT shall also work with UDRI and UT by providing consultation and if available, access to their manufacturing facility (i.e. autoclaves, furnaces, ect.) to accommodate the analytical methods and optical diagnostics for process control being developed by UDRI and UTRI.
 C-CAT shall also provide SME support to UDRI and UTRI throughout this project to assist in the development, fabrication, testing, and assessment of C/C composites and sub-elements fabricated.  C/C  composites defined in the project shall be of C-CAT standard materials, fabrication, coating and oxidation resistance methods and capable of maintaining mechanical properties after exposure to air at 2800¬∞ F (1538¬∞ C) for up to 50 hours."

These materials are targeted for use in reusable hypersonic vehicle designs and the program will be characterizing the deformation of these materials in various geometries and loading conditions.  The DIC system is the only way to measure strain fields over a 3D region.  The 3D deformation field measured will be used to validate models that predict the behavior of the material under simulated flight conditions.  In addition, the specific equipment requested meets the spatial resolution and data acquisition speeds needed for the hypersonics application."
