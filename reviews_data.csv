Ahmed Indian Restaurant 1,"11301 S Orange Blossom Trl, Ste 104",3.5,"We have been to Ahmed indian restaurant and it was one of our great food experiences in Florida, USA. The foods are just awesome so does the service. Thanks a lot and we would definitelt like to come back again...","We tried their lunch buffet, all dishes were cooked to perfection and service was great. Will go again!","I have never, ever had Indian cuisine this delicious! I've enjoyed Indian in cities coast to coast. Every item we tried was a complete win, eye rolling and all. When we asked for mild, it was mild. The flavors in the spices were very complex. Even the Papadum blew my mind. There were many West Indian families there. And it was so reasonable - I have paid twice as much for microscopic portions at PaneraBread. Just drop everything and go there, now.","Grill items were terrible - damn cook never ate kabob in his life; dry, skinny and disgusting and pricey compare to other good places . Everyone in my team was pissed.",Disgusting food! They served biriyani made with 2-3days old stinky rotten rice. Never ever go unless you wanna have food poisoning.,"Worst food ever !!! Don't even think of coming here ... Tried buffet it sucks .. Tried biryani my good ness it sucks ... It looked like colored rice... Chicken stinks and finally tea looks like a glass of water with some milk ...

Don't ever ever come here !!!",148,1
Ahmed Indian Restaurant 2,10042 University Blvd,4.0,"Highly recommended! Try them out. Great service and even better food. Lamb tikka is delicious! 

Ordered catering from their other location on OBT before and it was great! Must try!",Ordered via uber eats.. very flavorful and that medium heat on the spice is a kicker. Thank goodness i love spicy food. Ordered the seafood Kahari with a side of naan. Small portion but filling.,Great place delicious food it couldn't get better and a really convienent locatation. A must try,"Worst Indian food ever!!! I'm giving it a one-star rating because I will not be able to post my experience here if I don't give it a minimum rating. 

Tandoori chicken was not fresh at all and its taste was so bad, it felt like that chicken was marinated so many days ago! And the butter chicken was so tangy! The mix veg sabzi curry was absolutely tasteless. Never gonna go here again, ever! I certainly wasted my money on this crappy food, please don't waste yours!!!",If you only eat Pakistani food. Do not eat here! Very bland. I've wasted too much money @ this place. Americans and Indians will love this place though.,"I can make better Indian food by myself. I placed an order for carry out, the portion of food was too small and the food didn't seem fresh and lacked flavor.",139,1
Bachata Breeze Restaurant,5773 Curry Ford Rd,3.0,"AMAZING FOOD! Simple, delicious, inexpensive Latin buffet. The service is good, although servers can get a bit behind if the place gets busy, mostly on Sundays. It's a small buffet with amazing selections! Best Latin food in the area!!!!",For dancing this place is awesome! The food is suspect but good enough to eat. You can't go wrong with a buffet.,Great price $4.99for a Latin buffet.  Good variety.  Hot and very tasty. My family has been going twice a week.  Simple can't get a better deal.  Great value,Went In one night and the kitchen was closed but the actual restaurant was open?? Very confusing. I asked for a shake and they couldn't do it... Never went back! Why be opened when you aren't serving anything?,Horrible experience. Everything was on the empty side. The rice was SUPER HARD. The meat was mediocre. I don't understand how the other reviews are decent. We even told the woman working there and she still gladly took our debit card to charge us lol we barely touched our food. The is from the buffet. Maybe the menu food is better but super overpriced.,My husband and I both got sick eating here. The food was also unremarkable and the music was depressing.,9,1
Backlot Express,351 S Studio Dr,3.5,Love it here - SO easy and reasonably priced.. A great option after running a lonnnnngggg marathon.,"Great quick stop.  Star Wars themed.   Good munchies like hot dogs , burgers, and chicken fingers.  

Beer too!!","Quick and convenient.  I used mobile order pick and avoided all of the lines.  
The cheese burger was good...  and the key lime dessert was amazing!!!!",Overpriced mediocrity at its finest. Disney taking advantage of hungry people stuck in a park that are willing to pay way more than they need to for bottom of the barrel food.,When McDonald's serves fresher quality food than you.. you're doing something wrong. AVOID,This place smells really bad on the inside and served me one of the worst burgers I've ever had the displeasure of eating.,130,1
Bamboo Garden Super Buffet,3125 Columbia Blvd,2.5,"Was there last night about 630, food was fresh, service was good. Good variety. Can't complain about anything. We will go back",This buffet is great. Ate there last Wednesday. Food was very fresh and plentiful. Mongolia BBQ is very good.,"NEVER had a problem here and we eat here once or twice a month, service ok food usually good and have the sushi each and every time and never a problem....",Awful. We went early on a Sunday evening. No one was there but the buffet was FULL so you know that stuff had been sitting out. Food that should have been hot was cold and vice versa.  The meats were dry - either from being overcooked or from sitting out. My in-laws said they had positive experiences before but it had really declined.,"What a joke , got there at 8:30, they were already closing the buffets down said we could order anything that we wanted yeah they gave us a hassle every time we try to get some thing and now are trying to make us pay for stuff we can't even order but we shouldn't have to order something from all you can eat buffet.",The owner of the restaurant was a very rude lady she doesn't know how to communicate with the customers and also I got there at 11am for lunch is the time that there open and owner made snide remark about me coming in early and owner seems to have a nasty attitude the food was good but very horrible customer service I wouldn't spend another dime there,11,1
Biergarten Restaurant,1510 Ave Of The Stars,4.0,"YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM!!!!

This is a super delicious German buffet.  You are seated at a table with another family there for the buffet (tables seat 8), you order your drinks, and then off you go--time to eat!!  Amazing entertainment, too!

Don't go when the park is super busy, though (i.e. Thanksgiving), as you'll end up waiting in line for the buffet.  Boo.",Always amazing! Sitting with a different family is weird at first but we really enjoyed our new friends. All the food is delicious and the entertainment is fun and authentic! Never been disappointed!!!!,"We were pleasantly surprised with this buffet. We went for dinner and were surprised to see a show during the time we were there. The show was great and our daughter loved the dancing. The buffet has some unique German  meats and fish choices which was awesome. Beer selection was great to. The tables are long and you may end up sitting with other diners, but it ends up being a good time.","BUFFET ONLY! This experience was terrible. We had no idea idea this place was buffet only and that we were required to have at least 4 people to get the buffet. All we wanted was beer and apps. So since we had already got our beers we were stuck, we has to get the buffet. So expensive for what we got. And all we wanted was beer.",Food wasn't that good. Had to wait in long like for small buffet. Had to share a table with another family which isn't cool. I was just mad at the whole experience. But the beer was good so,"Not worth the money. Food was mediocre.
 Empty buffet dishes were not restocked. 
 I couldnt even get the ONE thing I really wanted, a pretzel roll,
 because staff did not refill bread baskets.
Apple strudel served warm was hard, crunchy, and dry.
Very disappointed :(",601,1
Boi Brazil Churrascaria,5600 International Dr,4.0,"Ligamos antes para reservar no restaurante, fomos atendido pelo Alexandre que foi tão gentil e resolvemos conhecer, ao chegar o atendimento foi melhor ainda.
Preço justo e alta qualidade!!!
Sensacional!!!","Great place.  Service was excellent, great selection of meat, very well seasoned and outstanding.  Not as high end as other franchise places but the price isn't nearly as high.  Very comfortable and excellent food","Amazing authentic Brazilian style churrascaria, high quality food, great service, and affordable prices, overall the best of all worlds. My recommendation would be their bacon wrapped filet mignon.",Just horrible went with my mother and all I stared at for a long time was al bundy with his hands in his pants standing next to the bar. Food was horrible. And nobody spoke English wtf. Never returning again,If you have any sense you will not eat here! Don't know how they are in business.! The food is salty the meat is tough- the salad bar sucks - was the only late night place open- wish I had not gone in at all - should have walked out when first walked in. It was so hot in the restaurant. The tables are on top of each other and the the bathroom was dirty. Should have left at that point. I already had a bad feeling,"Wasn't impressed with the meat and it wasn't really flavorful. The place was in a bad looking plaza so if you're expecting anything nice, don't. Inside it's ok looking.  All in all it was very mediocre. I would have given 3 stars if the waiter ""Paul "" didnt botch my bill .. I was in a hurry and trying to leave and didn't realize he over charged me for my drinks !  I ordered 3 sodas, total. He charged me for  5 although that might not seem like much that is 3.25 per drink so it adds up.",374,1
Boston Lobster Feast,8731 International Dr,3.0,If you love lobsters then this is the place for you.  The lobsters were great. Raw oysters were good and the shrimp dishes were great too. The service was fantastic also.,Great value for the money. Sangria's to die for there. Quality lobster and crab legs. Desserts not so much.,Which restaurant or buffet will offer u unlimited lobsters or crab legs?? 50$ but delicious seafood with friendly waitress. Somewhere else u pay 20$-30$ for one lobster but here u can have how many u can eat. Its messy to clean that but its actually pretty cool work for the delicious meat.,We walk right when it just open. Left over crab legs and lobsters from the day before. Probably others foods are left over too. Not much selection on the buffer line. Lobster are tiny. Only one lobster per dish so don't let the review pictures that people have multiple lobster on their dish trick you. Over price and under cook!,My boyfriend has eaten here before and liked it. We ate here on a Monday night and had food poisoning all night and the next day. We are here on vacation and it ruined our day. The people who work there are very nice! The food was okay but not worth the $45 price and sickness. Im from Maryland where there is amazing seafood and this was not even close to good for the cost.,"DO NOT GO HERE!! The food was terrible (bland, luke warm) and this place is way over priced! After eating here, I became very sick to my stomach!! I can think of a million other ways to spend $162!! (2 adults & 3 kids). We will NEVER visit this place ever again!!",774,1
Breakfast with Goofy and his Pals,10100 Dream Tree Blvd,5.0,Kids?  Then you just have to do this.  It's a riot.  See for yourself.  Worth the cost for a kids adventure they will talk about for years.,"First off let me say, we had reservations at the mickey and pals lunch buffet at the contemporary hotel. After reading reviews and checking out the actual price of their service,  we decided to cancel. They give you a buzzer and you would have to come to them. NOW this was 10 times better, cheaper, and the food was amazing. Worth every penny. If you're doing ANY character breakfast. Don't waste your time unless it's HERE",The best!!! Seeing my 3 year old being so happy was worth the 46 Dollars mediocre breakfast,Kids?  Then you just have to do this.  It's a riot.  See for yourself.

Buffet City,4551 13th St,3.0,"Greatest Chinese All You Can Eat Restaurant in St Cloud..., a huge variety of all kinds of Food... a little something for everybody ..... I do miss the Old Ice Cream Machine......Sushi Display is Excellent.... lots of parking. A++++",awesome food! you cant get good sushi for that price! a hidden gem for chinese food and sushi lovers!,"This place is fantastic! The food is tasty, people are friendly and the Sushi bar has a wide variety of delicious treats!!",I hate to give such a low rating to a hometown restaurant. I was shocked by how the quality of the food has declined in the last 2 years. There is plenty of selection with a lot of variety however everything I had was below average in taste in quality.  Lunch was $8.65 without a drink. It is definitely below average when compared with other Chinese buffet. I would not recommend it.,All I have to say is DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!! I feel filthy after eating here!!! We ate here before few years ago so we decided to stop by last night oh man never again!! Food was all cold the steak I order tasted like it smelled burnt just awful :( at least the waiter was fast and nice,This Place should change their name from BUFFET CITY to BARF CITY. I've spent my adult life eating at Asian Buffets but this clearly is one of the worst. From old re-steamed crab legs to oily soggy fried shrimp. In one word YUK! I left hungry! Every dish tasted the same. Not good!!!!,76,1
Cafe Gauguin,9840 International Dr,3.0,"We came here for a business lunch with clients during a conference at the hotel.  It was horribly decorated--it looked like a scene from the cafe on Saved By The Bell (The Max)!

BUT the service was amazing--friendly and fast.  And the buffett was really good.  Extensive, the food was full and fresh and tasty!

Highly recommend!","Thanksgiving buffet has been fantastic! The food is plentiful and a large variety! Something for everyone of every age! Servers all have a smile, even tho they are working the holiday. Well done holiday buffet!","The best thing about this place is its employees. As soon as I walked up to the cafe, I was greeted by a nice host. My waitress immediately checked in to see if I need the menu or whether I'm here to use the buffet. 
I ordered the salmon and the waitress smiled and told me it was a good choice. It actually was! Healthy and simple. The order came in fast and I never had to wait for anything. Definitely the best experience in the hotel I've had getting food!",The buffet is 17 dollars and the variety is like the free breakfast at Super8. The food was out for a long time and cold.,"Had my morning breakfast from here. The eggs were runny, the bacon was soft, the sausages were the worst! It all tasted very nasty. For $21.00, I was ripped off. The server was tentative but was not worth the mandatory 18% included on the billing but understand that if tip is based on the quality of food here no one would leave a tip!  

They do have a good assortment of fruit.","Food was good, service was lacking, which is fine because it's a buffet, but if your going to automatically add 18 percent you should earn it. The only thing the server did was offer a drink which I declined, but I had to pay $2.87 for the privilege of her offering that. I even had to start walking out of the restaurant for her to even bring the check",49,1
Cafe Matisse,9700 International Dr,3.0,"Very good food, good dervice, and reasonable price. The buffet is not extensive but uou get the prime rib, and 2 or 3 other proteins, good salad bar, and good sides.
You also get 5 different desserts and ice cream
They have a good 25% discount coupon on the website of the hotel.","I only had a carry out salad here but it was very good with grilled chicken, candied pecans, and apples. They let me substitute the ""chicken salad"" kind of chicken it came with for ""grilled chicken"" that I wanted. 
It was a good size, fresh, and filling.","While staying at the Rosen we enjoyed dinner at Cafe Matisse.  They weren't offering the buffet so we decided to give the full menu a shot.  While the menu was burger heavy we decided to try the Short Ribs, and Salisbury Steak.   Both were well prepared, and service was quite fast.  Both meals where very good, and prices were line with what you'll pay at any hotel/resort restaurant.  Upon our next business stay at the Rosen we will make to stop on by.","My family and I had lunch here on Saturday before visiting ICE! at nearby Gaylord Palms.  Very poor selection and quality of food.  18% tip automatically added to bill.  For 3 people for a buffet lunch, with taxes and tip, total was just under $50.  The quality of food was equivalent to Golden Corral.  Would not recommend this place.",Worst breakfast buffet over priced and tip included at 18. Percent for only 2 people and its serve yourself it was $34 for us and the bar is Skippy with a lot of breads and things to fill you up. The best part was the omelet made to order. Hotel is great this place sucks,"Be careful when you receive your check.  They automatically add an 18% gratuity fee, but still have a space on the check for a tip.  The menu probably indicates an automatic gratuity fee; however, we all had the buffet and did not look at the menu.  We did not see any signs posted and none of the servers notified of this policy. By the way, there were only 2 people in our party and both had the buffet, so the server involvement with us was limited.",29,1
Café Osceola,9939 Universal Blvd,3.5,"We had the breakfast buffet two days in a row and we loved it!!!!  Simo was our server, he was friendly and attentive. We were staying at the Rosen and really enjoying our stay. The fresh fruit was incredible, I've never seen berries so big and sweet. The chef who made our omelette did a wonderful job, he was very generous with fillings. This buffet is definitely a repeat","I am never a fan of a hotel breakfast.  Over priced and just ok usually BUT I was pleasantly surprised here.  The baked egg avocado dish was amazing.  I highly recommend my fellow avocado lovers, try this dish!  I do wish there was outdoor seating but other than that, perfect!","If you want to try multiple cuisines.  If you love cioppino, antipasto, paella, seafood, veal and all excellent food, check this out on the holidays.  Have been for Mother's Day Christmas, Thanksgiving and have never been disappointed.  Desserts are a showstopper, usually on holidays a choice of 30.  Service is excellent.  Great chocolate fountain.  You really should check this out, it's a bit of a local secret.  (oops!)","This is worst buffet i have ate in a long time.  The lettuce was not filled for five min, the shrimp was old and the prime rib was the end piece.  Then went back to try a second round of prime rib and it was not even cooked.   So the guy put a piece on a grill and it was burnt.   I then went back for dessert and they had three items out but had 8 signs for dessert.  

Would not recommend for dinner Buffett","The food was not very hot on the buffet. the server ask if things were alright,we siad not really. but instead of offering something 
else,she insisted on deserts.  Not worth 25.00 per person on a limited buffet at this price. do not waste your time or money on this restaurant.","Update, as you can see the manager left a comment below saying he was going to follow up. Just want to let everybody know that he never responded to my email so it appears this was just an empty gesture the fool Yelp users into thinking this business would follow up on poor experiences. I've revised my rating down to one star to reflect this shady practice.",59,1
Chef Mickey's,4600 World Dr,3.5,Yeay!!! Kids and grand kids had a great meal! nana was pleasantly surprised at how tasty and delicious her salmon was and the kids had fun taking horoscope with the characters... All in all a GREAT time... Worth the trip!!!,"We've dined here 4 times now, and I'm finally just now getting around to doing a review (and we'll be back here in December!!)

This is a MUST for each Disney vacation. We just can't help it.

There's a little bit of everything for all tastes - and the characters come around to your table to sign autographs and pose for pictures. They do a little dance, napkin spin thing every once in awhile and that's fun.

It is loud - so if you are looking for a nice quiet dinner, this is not for you.","Phenomenal breakfast experience. We have been able to attend 6-7 character meals, and this breakfast was top notch for little kids. The theming was very traditional Disney, and the characters were great. 

As we entered, there was a Photopass opportunity with Pluto. Then, Mickey, Goofy, Donald, and Minnie all visited our table. 

The breakfast food was all very good. Although it was pricey for breakfast, I felt there was good value compared to the price of other character meals.","Three words: ""Just say no."" ""Don't do it"" would also suffice. The food was ok - hit and miss on the buffet, as with most buffets. The difference? I spent well over $200 for a family of five to eat basically Western Sizzlin with Disney characters. Since kids 10+ are adults in this fantasy world, 2 of my 3 kids (by everyone else's definition of the word) cost the full adult price. Not so magical Disney.",Horrible food. All the food in the buffet was lukewarm. Everytging I picked tasted like it had been sitting way too long. Had to ask twice for the characters to stop at our table. The price is ridiculous. Our waiter was exceptional. That is honestly the only positive thing I can say.,"Don't let them fool you, a reservation means nothing.  If you have small kids rethink this -
We were still waiting 30 after our reservation time and we came 10 min early to check in.  

Others here before us were clearly frustrated.",575,1
Cici's Pizza 1,7437 International Dr,2.5,"An excellent place to visit for all you can eat Pizza for around $5 !!


 Excellent variety of pizzas, always fresh - along with a selection of pasta, salad and desserts.


 Look around for 10% off coupons in most Florida publications for an additional discount, off the already excellent price.


 Located on International Drive, it is extremely easy to get to - if you use the i-ride trolley, there is a stop almost directly outside.


 Definitely check it out !","What can I say? It's just... Too much ahahha, the first time I ate there I was in heaven!!! Pizza and brownies??!!! LOVED IT!! if you want something YUM and for a very good price you should go to cici 's, one of my favorite places ... Seriously THE BROWNIES!! AMAZING!! lol","From the moment we walked in, we were treated amazingly! We had gone in with two coupons and the young lady at the cashier gladly helped us figure out which one was more beneficial. 
The pizza was tasty. They do special pizza just ask for whatever you want. The manager, Julio was so helpful also and would always ask if you needed anything further. 
Cinnamon rolls are delicious!! Definitely would go back when in Orlando!
Good food and amazing service!!",First time my family and I were trying this place... it was not good at all!!! The service/workers were rude and not helpful. The food was low quality and very few choices. The pasta was crusty and the salad bar looked old. I would not come back again.,Es ist billig und so schmeckt es auch.

Would definitely eat here again if we are in the area!","Had a coupon for buy one adult pizza buffet get one free. Took our family of 7 after going to Disney. It was less than $40 for all of us, two being children. They had a great salad bar that had very fresh vegetables on it. The pizza was fresh and great. They kept it rolling out.

This is another cheap meal option during your Disney vacation. They have cheesy garlic bread pizza which I think is really amazingly delicious. Also the pasta salad was good too.

I would rather eat a microwave burrito from 7/11 then eat at an CiCi's again.  I am not even going off on the fact that it is an insult to refer to what they serve as pizza. (or pasta as well).

The pancakes were AMAZING! Eggs were delicious. No powdered eggs here! The second day I had French toast and was NOT disappointed! Sunday the Disney characters come around for hints and photo ops. Definitely recommend this restaurant  for breakfast.,Honestly the breakfast buffet was great! It's a big spread with everything you can think of. For the buffet as long as an adult gets the buffet a child gets buffet for free. Can beat it especially if you are staying in the Hilton,This is not a quaint local restaurant. It is in the Hilton. We were disappointed as we've been trying to stick to local owned places. Food was acceptable but definitely hotel restaurant prices.  Wasted one breakfast - after we drove here we stayed. Should have in description that it's in the hotel. We would have skipped it.,Not too impressed. Our waiter strongly persuaded us to take the buffet and then we were told they didn't do poached eggs except by service. Staff in general were mediocre.,I ordered the fish tacos and found that they had a great flavor and were of a good portion. Size. There was plenty of meat and the lettuce/slaw mix blended well the fries were just ok. They were hot and not too thick; they just lacked excitement to make me wish that I had ordered a different side. I went with a few friends around 1pm and it wasn't crowded and service was reasonable. This is a good option if you are not able to go far for lunch while staying at the hotel.,18,1

We ate there three times (which is no small feat since they are only open for breakfast and lunch). Every time it was great.

Just thinking about it makes me want to go back. Yum!",Tucker was awful. It took us an hour and a half for breakfast. The omelet was wrong and it took about 20 minutes to fix it. There were tables turning over before we even were served. Other servers seemed to be great.,Waited 45 minutes for our a la Carte breakfast. Cereal was wrong and they didn't bring milk.

The next day we came back as a group and was scolded by a rude supervisor(?) with long blonde hair because half our group came 10 minutes later.

I also expected more from the characters.","The food is fine but prices are beyond ridiculous.  $42 for lunch plus tip brings it to $200 for a family of four.  We found out the hard way.

When I come back to Florida this place will be a defiant!",The worst food I ever eaten enen the salads were horrible soup nasty mac and cheese discussing also the ice cream was watered down I guess you get what you pay for 15 bucks down the drain,"If I could give this rathole a negative star rating I would. Complete dump, dirty, smelly, horrible food, servers were nice though, a bunch aloof but nice. Not a best foot forward representation of America, clientele there seemed to love their dining experience however.","I came here a long while back with family while we were on vacation together. We were all hungry and wanted something close to our hotel. This seemed like the best option since we've all got Golden Corrals back home and knew what to expect. 

Yeah, well...

Not only was this location the most expensive one we've ever been to (nearly $15 a person?!), it was also the dirtiest.

We learned our lesson and ventured a little farther each day for dinner.",123,1
Golden Corral Buffet & Grill 9,897 West Town Parkway,2.5,"Good selection of foods, would be 5 stars but the pot roast was pretty bland and the bourbon chicken while tasty was greasy as all get out. I love the carrot cake, the dessert selections are really good. Nice girl taking care of us, the girl who rang us up was super nice too.","Came here for lunch, $9, not a lot of meat this time, but it isn't too bad. About fruits, melon is great but orange is too old, not fresh. Desserts are amazing, I love chocolate cake and chocolate fountain

Fruit 2/5
Dessert 5/5
Price 5/5","They just remodeled and the food is the same, except they have just upgraded the quality of the steak which makes it worth the price.   I go for a large salad with the freshly cooked steak.","Used to be a great place to eat. Last few times there the food has been horrible. Both the food and the restaurant are dated and tired. 
Do not recommend! 
Went again. Should not have. The prime rib was tasteless and the shrimp were burnt! Will never, ever go back.","Used to be a great place to eat. Last few times there the food has been horrible. Both the food and the restaurant are dated and tired.

Dinner was really good too! Pizza was homemade and delicious. Kids eat free for dinner too!","Food was good. Great selection. Jeffrey was the best waiter I've ever had!!!! His service is excellent, every time I needed something he was already getting it. He even recommended a bunch of places for us nearby too which was nice.",This is our favorite spot to grab dinner when we are staying across the street at the Wyndham Bonnet Creek.  Casual and delicious!  We love to sit outside on the patio and enjoy the breeze.  The cocktails are delish and every meal we've ever had is so yummy!  Our faves are the salmon and burger.

Hokkaido Chinese & Japanese Buffet 1,5737 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy,3.5,"Here in Florida on our Disney vacation. Decided we wanted some seafood but needed a break from Disney prices so decided to check this place out. The food was good, your typical Asian buffet fare with sushi, hibachi grill, and dim sum. But we were blown away by how cheap it was to eat here, especially when you're use to DC prices which are easily 2-3 times more expensive for the same or worse food!","Excellent place! My expectations were far exceeded. The price was very affordable at $12 and they had everything the expensive buffets feature. Clams, blue crab, several fresh kids of fish, a raw bar and huge sushi selection!!  Wow!!!","very good and save more when you use 20% off coupon on yelp.
The waiters are friendly and you should never miss it!",This is a worst place I have never been. All servers are talking while I ask for some helps. The host does not care about their customers even tho we are just standing in front of her. I would like to give 0 star if I can!,The food was tasteless. I probably ate only half a plate and could not eat anymore.

Hokkaido Chinese & Japanese Buffet 2,12173 S Apopka Vineland Rd,3.0,a huge selection of sushi and a great buffet. unbelievable price for the selection and quality. I was very satisfied and will be back.,The hibachi is really good and the service here is really good! The waiters were very patient and honest.,"I have to to say I came in with not super high expectations, but this place was very impressive! There was so much to choose from and so many ingredients you can choose to make your own hibachi. We'll probably visit again next time we are around!",Worst buffet.  Food was COLD. I would never go again.   The fruit was warm.  Nothing hat should have been hot was hot.  I was scared it would make me sick.,"The price was right, but as they say ""you get what you pay for""; the food was awful, some dishes looked down right scary and I've eaten at many Asian buffets. The tables and chairs were smeary wet where the waitress hurriedly sat us down under water dripping from a vent onto my shoulders. Oh, had to ask waitress several times to bring our drinks...service questionable",All the food was fresh since we got there at opening but flavors were awful. I think the only thing that had good flavor was the ice cream and sodas.,331,1
Hollywood & Vine,351 S Studio Dr,3.0,My favorite Disney breakfast buffet and character meet and greet! Their cheesy grits hit the spot on a cold November morning! They even have an omelette station for the adults made to order! Best tip - be the first family in at 8 am for a special surprise!!!,"We LOVE HollyWood and Vine! Their character breakfast is the best if you have kids who love Disney junior! They have Jake, Sofia, Handy Manny, and Doc McStuffins! The breakfast itself is great too, lots of variety and a lot of food for picky eaters like my two kids. The characters all spend a good amount of time at your table too, which is great! We love it here!","What a BLAST!  We had the buffet breakfast and it was awesome.  Plenty of healthy choices such as a build your own yogurt or oatmeal station, as well as some tasty indulgences such as the corn beef hash-a must have and the cheesy potatoes! The kids (2&5) loved the Mickey waffles and tatter tots.  Every 15 minutes the characters would do an interactive dance and invite the kids to join in! We are going back in May and I have already booked my reservation!!","Being season pass holders we have eaten many times at H&V.  Feels as if the service (no one smiles and feels like they care how your experience is) and the food have gone downhill -- def feels like a very expensive middle school lunch cafe line.  

You do get the characters so if that's your reason for your going - it's fine.","Extremely expensive, $50 per person for lunch, and the food was cold, the fish was not fresh, the macaroni and cheese was sticky, the salad was watery, and even the wine was bad.

Steve and Mamie  Brunswick,  Ga",Ichiban's was great!  They were able to accommodate a party of 30 on 30 mins notice!  Didn't give me any trouble and made sure they had staff there to support our group.  I heard several comments that the food was good and enjoyed the selections myself.  Very much appreciate their help and accommodations!,"the only reason they got one star is yelp doesn't offer no star. The place was dirty and hot. food they served was one step away from the garbage. Better yet thrown in the garbage. I was afraid for my life. The owner should be ashamed. Health ispectors should shut them down. I felt sorry for the crab legs,  shrimp, and what looked like fish... totally destroyed... the only food that wasn't destroyed was pudding it remains coagulated like a blob and keeps is slimy form for days. co mon man!",Been there a few times and it went from mediocre to horrible. I will never set foot in this place again. The food is bland and ill prepared. I have never had such bad Chinese food.,"Don't bother going. Service still stinks, plates piled up on table as waiters and waitresses kept passing us by. Food was mediocre and cold. Sushi selection was pathetic.

-Joey from Longwood",Oh heck no after they failed their health inspection I'm definitely not coming back because the food didn't taste all that good and it wasn't that my cup of tea.,While sitting eating our food a cockroach crawled out of the napkin holder and across the table. When I told the waitress they didnt even take the napkin holder off the table or find the roach they just wiped the table and sat someone new in the seat.,"My friend and I ate here for dinner.  Saturday night 6.30p.m.  chicken and broccoli was old and dried up. After round 2 my friend went to get the pepper shrimp and the lady was cleaning the counter with her dirty rag and had a piece of shrimp in the rag and put it back in the food on the Buffett table.

I'm so surprised with the service and interior design too. I'd definitely recommend going here. Price is pretty good too, but if you're hungry, where else would you go?? 5stars!!!",Great lunch specials and amazing korean BBQ. The one on E colonial also has great scenery and is open late. Jist wish you could sit with friends when they get Korean bbq and not yourself.,This was my first time going to a Korean barbecue place and I loved it I had the brisket and the pork belly there it was magnificent I don't know if it was the way they prepared it before they gave it to us or how we cooked it but the next time I go back I'm definitely going to get the brisket again and I definitely will recommend this place I want to try other Korean barbecue places,"Walked in around midnight to get some sushi and I was told they don't have any ""open tables"" but they literally had 18 tables open.  Just sounded like they don't like the business or they just don't care about the customers. In fact the lady wanted us to wait for 30 minutes for a table to open? I'm very surprised to hear this and wonder what the owner thinks is happening at this restaurant.","Izziban used to be one of my favorite places to go & eat kbbq, but after being hospitalized from getting food poisoning I will no longer be a returning customer. I am deeply disappointed because of their poor sanitary condition and hygiene practices of their employees. This needs to be addressed because this is both a health and safety concern. You've all been warned.","I've been here two years ago , the food was very good. The side dishes at the bar had many good quality and variety as well as the sauces. The soup for the hot pot was very tastety and yummy. I was love everything about this place until yesterday.

King Buffet,2157 E Semoran Blvd,2.5,First time here driving through town and I wish I lived closer!  This buffet has the best Chinese food I have ever had at a buffet. Sushi was spectacular!!  Very impressed and I'll be looking for one closer to my home now.,Sometimes you go to a place and they have that salmon where you be like 'is this real?' And then you question it for days to follow when it feels like there's a squirrel fighting a python in your belly. Not this place. Their salmon is real. 100% real.,Its all all you can eat so come ready to eat and it have a little something for everyone plus the price is not bad and you spend under $10 for each person depending on the time.  Eat as much as you can because you pay for it.,Where is a health inspector when you need one? You have a one in ten chance of finding a hot entree on the steam table. How exactly is that even possible? Darn if I know but King buffet has figured it out. The carpet should have been replaced about ten years ago and the overall environment gets a top rating in the Yuck category. I went here because it boasts of being the #1 in the Apopka area...number one what needs more explanation!,"I found a bug in my food . My first time going I ordered something simple, shrimp fried rice & crab Rangoon.

I start eating my rice and the second spoon I notice a bug/fly looking creature in my food. Needless to say I would never return.

Koywan Hibachi Buffet,"945 W State Rd 436, Ste 1179",3.0,Very modest lunch prices. Fresh fish in the sushi bar. Hibachi bar was tasty and fast. Good variety expected at an Asian buffet.,Great selection of fresh sushi(on a Saturday night). Great choices for seafood and vegetarians too:),"This is my favorite Asian buffet in the area.  It is in a little shopping center, but has a surprisingly beautiful interior.  They have the typical dishes, a nice variety of desserts, and a really great sushi selection.  They also have a hibachi where you can create your own rice or noodle dishes with various meat, seafood, and vegetable options. They apparently jack up the price on holidays, which is unfortunate.  Otherwise, it's worth the trip.",The hot food was cold.the sushi was warm. I had to send my drink back because it had a film of grease on it. The teppen yaki told me how to pick my food then made my food wrong. Then when I made my concerns know I was told that I did it at the wrong time after the meal not during. Which I would have had I even seen a waitress to even refill my drink. I wish I could give less than one star.,"Food was ok, but not worth the price. Hostess was argumentative.  Not everyone likes seafood.  Every chicken dish was right next to some type of seafood so almost everything tasted like fish.  I'll never waste my money here again.",So annoyed with this place. The food was cold. I checked in using Yelp and was supposed to get a free kids buffet but they they charged me for my 2 year old so the coupon didn't even matter. The bathroom was dirty.

From the moment I walked in it was nothing but a great experience.   The staff was very friendly and the food was great! Would recommend if you are in the area or if not in the area to drive from wherever you are if you're in the mood for some great Chinese food!,This place is horrible. Food is awful and they do not restock the items. Do not go here. Very disappointed that I relied on the yelp reviews. Definitely would never come back,"Possibly the worst place I have been to in Orlando.  Went in for the lunch buffet and should have spent my money at RaceTrac.  When I walked in I was the only one in the restaurant, I should have known then to turn around and walk out.

Everything on the buffet was cold and many of the condiments were empty, how does that happen since they have only been open an hour.

I would not recommend this place to my WORST enemy.

SAVE YOUR MONEY DONT GO HERE!!!","If you are looking for a great Chinese restaurant this is not best place for you. If you like bland, unseasoned food then this is for you!

At 6:45 we were told they were out of it except very well done ! Very disappointing! When we were ready to leave the manager came out of the kitchen with some mor prime rib ! After we were told no more ?! Won't go back !waste of money !",Overpriced food and mediocre service.  Sure that works when you are in a restaurant with incredible ambiance in a wonderful location.  But this is a run down country club with what amounts to a sports bar.  And then every item seems to come with some sort of up charge.  Save your money for somewhere worthwhile.

I've never tried the buffet simply because I enjoy their sushi way too much. I wish I lived closer. I'd be there a couple times a week!","Horrible horrible horrible. Extremely dried out food and they wouldn't cook anything fresh in there buffet.
Way over priced for what you get. Stay Away.","Came here for lunch today for the buffet.  Like a couple of the Yelp Reviews the buffet portion is not good at all.  Maybe the dinner and sushi portion is better.  No variety what so ever, taste wasn't bad just wish it had more vegetable/meat choices besides.  Im sorry I won't be coming back.","Went on a Friday mid-afternoon and the buffet food was not only cold, but hard as well. It seems like the food has been sitting out for hours.

Great wine list, great service, highly recommend.",We enjoyed Latitude & Longitude so much that we came back two night's in a row. The Cheddar Poppers bread is wonderful way to start the meal. We were happy to learn that we could get a side salad with our meals. I enjoyed the Grouper and my daughter loved the Bacon Mac & Cheese.,"I have never had food poisoning before, but thanks to Latitude & Logitude, now I have. I ate lunch here on 5.1.18 while at the hotel for a conference. I wound up missing most of the conference as a result.

We ate here for lunch on our last day, too. It was ok- but I think I could've made the same mediocre southwest salad at home. Meh.",The decor of this restaurant is nice however the chef should probably offer a new Mediterranean menu.

But now after a few times I came, foods are really bad, poor limited selection and they charge my daughter $7.99 because they told her 3 feet 5. But she isn't.
$24 per person is not worthy anymore.
We will never come back.","Such a beautiful location with such marginal food. $22.95 for a ""seafood buffet"". Although crab legs were advertised, they were only available once (in a very small amount) - gone before I could get 1. The sushi did not taste fresh (hopeful that I don't get sick).
And for the price, a drink is not included. I would not suggest this location to anyone.",349,1
Minnie's Silver Screen Dine,351 S Studio Dr,3.5,"This is a wonderful experience. 

It is an all you can eat buffet. As you are eating your food the characters are walking around to take photos and sign autographs for the kids. 

This place gave me the warm and fuzzies. The characters are really good with the people they interact with.

My niece had a blast. 

The food was really good as well; much better than i expected it to be.",So this dinner buffet was delicious but was not as special as some of our other Disney dining experiences. It's definitely worth it for the characters though. Cocktails were just ok. Desserts were very good.,"Food was great and service was prompt but seriously who charges $30 for a kids buffet (and $50 for adults) when all they eat is corn dogs, chicken nuggets and mac and cheese.

Moghul Indian Cuisine,401 N Semoran Blvd,4.0,Delicious food and super attentive and friendly staff! The vegetarian options are so good. We will definitely be back.,"Shady on the outside, classy on the inside. $12 will get you a generous portion of chicken and rice. Very delicious. They start you off w complimentary flatbread-ish chips and 3 different savory dipping sauces. They're open decently late so you can enjoy a very quiet meal late in the evening. Will def go again...","Great Tikka Masala, fresh naan and great service. Definitely OUT of my way but worth the trip!!!!!!","One of the worst Indian restaurants I've ever been to. The food was so bland, very few options at the buffet and service was terrible. We asked for a bowl and they told us to fill 5 tiny sauce cups. Seriously?! Horrible, insulting service.",Food did not sit well with my stomach! It seems I am not the only ones reading the other reviews.

Nine Spices Hot Pot,5320 S Kirkman Rd,4.0,Restaurant is very clean. Good variety of food to chose from for the all you can eat. Excellent service!,"Soooo good, fresh and very healthy. I come here every time I'm in town. love this place.",It was amazing and is worth the try! Servers are great and recommended a lot of stuff to us!,Food was not fresh. Serve was nearly nonexistent. Asked for clams and did not receive it during the entire visit. Server did not visit our table even once.,"So. When the staff can't identify what is in your bowl, that's a good indication you should not put it into your body. 

Made that mistake. The squid balls came back violently.

Oreganatta,6320 International Dr,2.5,"Pizza Delivery...amazing!  I have never been to the location, but have ordered their pepperoni pizza 3 times for delivery, and it is exceptional.

I would call it close to New York style, thinner crust, and definitely a lot of garlic going on.  Absolutely terrific pepperoni pizza.

I'm very surprised to see all the bad reviews, most are regarding the location, or the pasta or salad bar prices.  My suggestion:  stick to the pizza and I expect you'll be pleased!","For the price, the food is amazing. The pizza is fresh and very good. The pasta is good too, fresh Alfredo sauce. Salad and desert is sub-par. Overall, a very satisfying experience.","No conozco mucho de restaurantes Italianos (mi comida favorita en el mundo) aquí en Orlando, pero este sitio lleno todas mis expectativas, buen precio, buen ambiente y sobretodo y Un agradable servicio. Lo recomiendo con los ojos cerrados","Did deserve the one star, my family and I came here we didn't enjoy it at all. Go Cici pizza or stay  home and cook.","Tourist trap coffee tasted like water,  only choice of meat was chicken,  soups were tasteless.  Even the cheesy bread had no cheese.  All drinks were  $2.60 even water.  4 noodle choices and 4 sauce choices.  My son thought they had little cups of ghellato, turns out it's just whipped topping with flavorings on top.","Not as advertised. Waste of money. So bad we left hungry and had to go somewhere else to eat. Only 2 types of pizza. Cheese & pepperoni, very bland. Some salad toppings with stale croutons. Pasta with watery sauce and chewy dark meat chicken.",76,1
Phil-Asian Foodmart,2650 N Orange Blossom Trl,4.5,Went here on a weekend and they have a buffet food and pastries are very good. Theyre very helpful and friendly too.,Love this place! Feels like you are eating at a friend's house. The owner was so nice and accommodating. They serve buffet on the weekend. Price was very reasonable. Can't wait to visit again when I am back in Orlando.,"Excellent chicken adobo, the rice awesome. The place is nice and friendly. I can't wait to go there for there pancit.","Hard to find Filipino's places around Orlando for breakfast. This was the only one that had prepared hots foods to order.

We loved the sweet chicken with the garlic rice. The sinigang with pork wasn't that flavorful and the pork was really dried out and chewy. The milk fish tasted old and the longnise was so so.

The staff was very friendly and fun to be with.","Serving food everyday from breakfast to dinner. Buffet on weekends. Balik-bayan boxes, phone cards, money remittance, filipino groceries and more!

Plaza Garden Restaurant,9000 International Dr,3.5,"We stayed at Rosen Inn and had both breakfast buffet and dinner buffet at Plaza Garden Restaurant. Both were very good. Food was fresh, hot, well seasoned, and delicious. It was more than expected from a restaurant inside an inn. $9 for breakfast and $15  for lunch, it's a good choice for some lazy last day staying at the inn. Plus the service was excellent too.","Regular buffet.. the usual choices, toast, eggs, bacon, pancake etc.. Service was fine not much was needed since it's a buffet.

I was served by ""Willie"" and his service, courtesy and attention were just excellent.","Horrible buffet.  Dry chicken, dry hard meat loaf, ice cold pasta with sauce that tasted like canned tomato paste. Yuck!","First off, I give it zero stars. This automated system forces you to give it a star rating before one can proceed. The worst dinner we ever had. The staff dressed in poor attire. Kids were running all around the place, like it was a playground.  The food was terrible. The hot items on the buffet bar were cold. The steak was salted down. The lighting in the place was awful and it could use a paintjob.",The server was excellent however they did not have a lime for my Corona. Also they gave me a plastic bag and foil for my food to go.

Rosen Inn Lake Buena Vista,8442 Palm Pkwy,2.5,"We seriously only paid $52/night, thanksgiving week for a clean, spacious,  and recently remodeled room, 15 minutes from Disney. The staff were all friendly and helpful. For what we paid, we really lucked out. I was a little worried, but very happy (and surprised) by this hotel. If the weather would've been warmer, we could've taken advantage of the little water park area, which also looked nice for the kids.","Excellent hotel for the price! Room was clean and smelled fresh. I did not use pool, no gym that I know of, and buffet didn't look fresh, but I wasn't there during the busy season. These are the only downsides that I noticed but was overall a great place to stay and I would highly recommend! I liked that the location was gated and had a gate attendant at all hours, it felt very safe.","Perfect hotel if you are just going to the parks and needing a place to crash. Clean , comfortable. We have kids and it was perfect. Wifi is slow but we all need to disconnect anyway.  Family vacation means spending time with one another not surfing the net.",Service pretty much sucks here the management need to focus on customer service and not pass on the blame,"I was so excited about staying at this hotel. I called before and told them we would be arriving late. I get there to check in, and was informed they overbooked and are sending us to a sister hotel. I was informed it was better than this hotel. However it wasn't and was very disappointed.",Not worth the price at all! You pay $89 plus for a room and it's not even clean. I found hair in the sink and the tub and also blood on my sheets TWICE. Our room was only cleaned once on our four day stay( we stayed from 5/26/-5/30) the shuttles only run on average twice maybe three times a day depending on where you go. I rather spend extra to stay at a Disney Resort where I get the most out of my money.,145,1
Saffron Indian Cuisine 1,7724 W Sand Lake Rd,4.5,"Came here while on vacation in Orlando. Man oh man was that some tasty chicken! Just the right amount of spicy, the rice was fantastic with pretty good portion size. It was a little on the pricier side, but nothing outrageous for Indian food. If you're in the area, I would definitely recommend it.","The BEST indian restaurant in Florida. I've tried every single indian restaurant in south florida, and if Icould I  would drive to Orlando each month to go to Saffron! Incredible flavors and food!","The best Indian cuisine I've had since visiting London!

The lunch specials are a dynamite value.

Service was friendly and timely. 

We're coming back for dinner!","We are new to Orlando. Worst experience at this restaurant.  It was so disrespectful to us. Agreed, they were busy, but we stood at the greeters area for 12 minutes. No one bothered to even say hi or ask us to wait. I mentioned the same to the manager and left the place. They didn't care much though. Went to cedars next door, which was heaven. My request to management, please respect people first.",Sad to hear from one of the waiters that they charge different prices for tourist and locals.  They charged us double the price for extra bread ($8) and than apologized when they found out we live near by. Promised not to do it next time but no worries we won't be back!,"Food quality poor.

I'm glad we stumbled upon this and the staff recommended the buffet. Will come again! I am not one to eat Indian food, but after I left I craved more!","Excellent food, spotless restaurant and great service. Had the lamb kabob which was great and my wife had coconut curry chicken which was amazing!!!","I love this place! Their flavorful dishes are consistent, and they're run by some very sweet ppl. If you like really spicy food, ask for Indian Spicy...Amazing!! Love them, like I said consistency is something to be appreciated down here, and they consistently earn my business.",I was really looking forward to trying the food. It was the worst meal I ever had. The chicken was dry and hard to eat. Couldn't stomach eating the whole meal. Will not waste my money on this again.,Supposed to open at 11:30. It is now noon and they still aren't open. We have an appointment at 1. They just lost business.,Slowest service I have ever encountered!  Food came it wrong and had to be remade - then flavor was still mediocre.  Waited 30 minutes just to pay my bill.  Finally had to tell the guy to ring me out or I was leaving.  Yikes - would not recommend at all.,70,1

I suggest getting a pass so that you can visit as much as possible. The new sea lion high is a great show and a must see.","Getting into the park is a nightmare! No organization or people to control the crowd. Staff upon entry seemed miserable. Dirty and smelly bathrooms. I recommend leaving the park well before it closes. Again, no organization. We were stuck like a herd of cattle for over an hour.","Do not buy your tickets online in advance. They are non-refundable! Moreover they are not even transferrable. So if anything goes wrong with your trip they are worthless unless you plan to go to Orlando again within a year.

I got sick during our Florida trip and they refused to refund the tickets. After asking for a supervisor they offered to extend the validity of the tickets but I have no desire visiting a place that once they have your money they don't care anymore.","Sea world looks nice on the outside, but after my visit my fears were confirmed.

I'll definitely be back.","First time trying Indian food (went with a friend who is more experienced than me).  We shared the spicy butter chicken, although you can ask for a mild or medium flavor, with jazmin rice, garlic naan and aloo naan (has curry potatoes inside yummm).  Everything was sooo delicious, place was clean and servers were very attentive and friendly.  Overall I will come back and try other dishes!","Had the Chicken Vindaloo- Indian Hot... Man oh man was this good! The perfect level of heat & the flavor was outstanding! Better than some of the other high end Indian restaurants I've gone to in the Orlando area. 
Will be back for more",We came in with a large group and they accidently gave our appetizers to the table next to us. He realized his mistake then tried to serve us the half eaten appetizer! Soooo gross! Do not recommend unless youre okay with eating someone elses leftovers,Went for buffet. Food wasn't tasty. Server wasn't very polite. The only thing I liked was the dessert.,"The chicken korma was delicious. The garlic naan was nice, but the garlic was subtle and not very fresh. The paneer masala tasted well. They only brought out one bowl of rice for the two of us even though both meals called for rice. I love masala tea, but the tea here didn't seem fresh. It had a powder aftertaste to it that I didn't like. To top it off, meals were pricy for the area and dishes served. The food was good, but not at the level it'll be worth the price",94,1
Texas de Brazil,"5259 International Dr, Ste F1",4.0,"Spectacular, one of a kind restaurant with an elegant, serene atmosphere.

Too bad they don't have one in SoCal.","Everything is delicious! The salad bar is great, everything tastes fresh. But don't fill up too much because the meat is the best part. My favorites are the flank steak and the house sirloin. And they have my favorite dessert in the world; the bananas foster pie! Soooo good!!!",It's not the same anymore. Service and food no longer up to par. It's now an overpriced franchise. Go to fogo de Chao.,"Definitely not the right place for a holiday meal. Having eaten here many times before, I reserved a table for Easter Sunday.

But it is disney after all so i guess its ok for a special occasion.,Best food we've had this entire vacation! Great buffet has lots of light and healthy options and everything was fresh and delicious.,"Absolute worst character dining at WDW. Good luck seeing a character anytime during your meal. Also, the prices are absolutely outrageous, i.e., $100.00 for a party of three. Food quality is a little bit better than the Golden Corral. Only reason to go here is if you want to feel elitist and enter the Magic Kingdom before the peons who either could not book a reservation or cannot afford to eat here.","The only good thing I can say about this place was the service by my waitress other than that it was pretty crummy. I wanted it to be so much better. The plaza in Disneyland is very similar and manages to serve edible and great food, the crystal palace falls short. I think an MRE would provide a more pleasing taste, then the watery excuse of an omlete. For thirty a person one would think that they could get a closer alternative for eggs than egg beaters watered down.","Was kept outside for 27 minutes at 43F with a toddler. Regardless of my reservation. Then was given a table next to the door that does close entirely. 
The manager was somewhat helpful, 3 out of 10 point scale. Surprised to find that low service and stuff commitment.

The food is an excellent quality with a large variety to meet all tastes and needs. I enjoy eating here when we are at this resort. I highly recommend it.","A very good value. Buffet has many selections, and there's a small, low buffet area for children to serve themselves. On one particular evening, they had free face painting for the kids. There is a large dining area to accommodate several big families.","Great for kids, otherwise it will remind you of eating at a Perkins.  Almost everything is cooked well beyond recommended safe temperatures and times, and it is reflected in the taste and texture of the food.

But sometimes you just can't put a price on convenience when you have been slogging it around in Disney with a 105-degree​ heat index and early or late Magic Hours.

It is what it is, but I recommend the sports bar on site.  Better food.","Cannot beat the price for a buffet, but I expected more. In the military? You'll recognize the greasy taste of the bacon, and the powdered consistency of the eggs. 
I was excited for the kids buffet line; Until, I saw that it consisted of eggs, churros, and tater tots! Really?? No, ...really? 
The omelet station was nice, but the wait is rather long, get it the line ASAP and have them make your eggs to order.",Breakfast buffet is fine although a little pricey at $11.95.

Also, I got a free glass of wine for checking in via Yelp. One of the guys cooking the meats is super cute. I don't understand what the hype about this restaurant is, ugh. Definitely not worth the $33 I spent here. I think that the only reason this place may stay open is because of the location.

Service was bad but the food was awful...  The steaks were cold and chewy...   oysters were overcooked...

The reviews are so misleading and the food items are not what you expect them to be. Disappointing.,"Not worth $$$. Didn't even stay. Save your money! I thought it was a joke, their rate was $14.99 per adult and an 11 year old is considered adult price. They were 3 salads, 2-3 rice side orders and 4 meat dishes- that is all!","We being dining at Tony's (old Vittorios) for years, some days good some days just ok.

Upon entering it was a huge cluster of people, no social distancing, and an unorganized way to look for people to seat.

It's awful!  Don't waste your time or money.  My eggs were cold, bacon was drippy, and they ran out of croissants!  I could go on and on...but the only thing good was our server Phillip.   My recommendation is stick to Kekes.","Glorified sizzler-  I was so disappointed. In the quality of the food.  There are 6-7 stations of mediocre food that you will probably not enjoy.  The cost is $40 per person when it should be closer to $10.  My recommendation is leave the hotel and eat anywhere outside of the hotel for lunch. 

WHAT A BAD EXPERIENCE -  After spending $300 to get my family the Vip experience at ice (fantastic) this almost ruined are day",144,1
Whistle Stop Restaurant,2728 Cayman Cir,4.0,"George's Whistle Stop restaurant is a great place to eat and make new friends!  The food is delicious and reasonably priced. Owners and employees are exceptionally friendly. Diners are made to feel welcome by staff and other guests. Great place for lunch or dinner! Entertainment of different types is offered most nights, such as Karaoke, trivia, or DJ music.","What more can you ask for!  The food is excellent, the beer is cold, the waitresses are sweet as carrot cake.  Don't pass up the desserts whatever you do.  The cooks know their stuff and cook up a storm. I love coming here whether it is for a beer or tear up a prime rib that they offer on certain days.  Everybody that works there has the right attitude. Go Brenda and Kathy...we love u.","Found this restaurant on yelp, almost didn't stop when we seen it was a gated community. Glad we did it is open to the public. The food was great and big portions.","What you need to know about this restaurant is that it is IN a golf course that is IN a 55+ community. The ambiance is definitely ""old folks' dining hall"". The food is good and inexpensive but nothing spectacular. You won't stumble across this place but if you're visiting someone in the community it's a decent place to grab a bite to eat or a beer.",Great food and great drinks for an amazing price.  The Whistle Stop Restaurant costs very little and has such a great atmosphere.  Great place for a quick meal any ole night of the week or a first date especially if you are on a budget.,"Well, after months of my review being up, a Rick S. Wrote to me and said that this was a retirement community and not intended for children. Got it Rick. My family with young children aren't welcome when visiting grandparents. Next time we'll be sure not to support the local establishment, I know there are far better options in Apopka and Orlando that are more welcoming.",9,1
