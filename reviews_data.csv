Ahmed Indian Restaurant 1,"11301 S Orange Blossom Trl, Ste 104",3.5,"We have been to Ahmed indian restaurant and it was one of our great food experiences in Florida, USA. The foods are just awesome so does the service. Thanks a lot and we would definitelt like to come back again...","We tried their lunch buffet, all dishes were cooked to perfection and service was great. Will go again!","I have never, ever had Indian cuisine this delicious! I've enjoyed Indian in cities coast to coast. Every item we tried was a complete win, eye rolling and all. When we asked for mild, it was mild. The flavors in the spices were very complex. Even the Papadum blew my mind. There were many West Indian families there. And it was so reasonable - I have paid twice as much for microscopic portions at PaneraBread. Just drop everything and go there, now.","Grill items were terrible - damn cook never ate kabob in his life; dry, skinny and disgusting and pricey compare to other good places . Everyone in my team was pissed.",Disgusting food! They served biriyani made with 2-3days old stinky rotten rice. Never ever go unless you wanna have food poisoning.,"Worst food ever !!! Don't even think of coming here ... Tried buffet it sucks .. Tried biryani my good ness it sucks ... It looked like colored rice... Chicken stinks and finally tea looks like a glass of water with some milk ...

Don't ever ever come here !!!",148,1
Ahmed Indian Restaurant 2,10042 University Blvd,4.0,"Highly recommended! Try them out. Great service and even better food. Lamb tikka is delicious! 

Ordered catering from their other location on OBT before and it was great! Must try!",Ordered via uber eats.. very flavorful and that medium heat on the spice is a kicker. Thank goodness i love spicy food. Ordered the seafood Kahari with a side of naan. Small portion but filling.,Great place delicious food it couldn't get better and a really convienent locatation. A must try,"Worst Indian food ever!!! I'm giving it a one-star rating because I will not be able to post my experience here if I don't give it a minimum rating. 

Tandoori chicken was not fresh at all and its taste was so bad, it felt like that chicken was marinated so many days ago! And the butter chicken was so tangy! The mix veg sabzi curry was absolutely tasteless. Never gonna go here again, ever! I certainly wasted my money on this crappy food, please don't waste yours!!!",If you only eat Pakistani food. Do not eat here! Very bland. I've wasted too much money @ this place. Americans and Indians will love this place though.,"I can make better Indian food by myself. I placed an order for carry out, the portion of food was too small and the food didn't seem fresh and lacked flavor.",139,1
Bachata Breeze Restaurant,5773 Curry Ford Rd,3.0,"AMAZING FOOD! Simple, delicious, inexpensive Latin buffet. The service is good, although servers can get a bit behind if the place gets busy, mostly on Sundays. It's a small buffet with amazing selections! Best Latin food in the area!!!!",For dancing this place is awesome! The food is suspect but good enough to eat. You can't go wrong with a buffet.,Great price $4.99for a Latin buffet.  Good variety.  Hot and very tasty. My family has been going twice a week.  Simple can't get a better deal.  Great value,Went In one night and the kitchen was closed but the actual restaurant was open?? Very confusing. I asked for a shake and they couldn't do it... Never went back! Why be opened when you aren't serving anything?,Horrible experience. Everything was on the empty side. The rice was SUPER HARD. The meat was mediocre. I don't understand how the other reviews are decent. We even told the woman working there and she still gladly took our debit card to charge us lol we barely touched our food. The is from the buffet. Maybe the menu food is better but super overpriced.,My husband and I both got sick eating here. The food was also unremarkable and the music was depressing.,9,1
Backlot Express,351 S Studio Dr,3.5,Love it here - SO easy and reasonably priced.. A great option after running a lonnnnngggg marathon.,"Great quick stop.  Star Wars themed.   Good munchies like hot dogs , burgers, and chicken fingers.  

Beer too!!","Quick and convenient.  I used mobile order pick and avoided all of the lines.  
The cheese burger was good...  and the key lime dessert was amazing!!!!","MAKE IT STOP!!!!  TOTAL GARBAGE.

Let me just say that if you want fast food that tastes worse than McDonalds, this is the place for you!!

Crappy chicken nuggets, crappy fries, crappy salad and not enough seating.  All food was subpar. 

Both of the diet coke dispensers on one side were completely out of syrup, so after waiting 5 minutes for my turn to get my drink I had to go wait another 5 minutes at a machine that actually had some available.

This restaurant is also soooo dirty. Crap was all over the floor and if you could actually find an empty table, rest assured there was ketchup or something spilled or smeared all over it.

Just gross. Seriously gross.","This was the worst food we had during our whole Disney experience by a long shot. I don't understand why the food here was so much worse (and more expensive) than for instance Cosmic Ray's Cafe at the Magic Kingdom. Shouldn't they be equivalent across all parks? I guess not! Maybe the different casual cafes are run by different companies. 

Anyhow, I highly recommend not coming here. The food was really expensive and it was really bad. And by that I mean you will spend $12 on a tiny nearly inedible sandwich. It is also much smaller than some of the cafes at the other parks and we had to sit outside half the time. Eventually my husband scored an inside table much to our relief. 

This was after we had hiked all over the Hollywood studios looking for a place to eat. Everywhere we went it was super crowded with huge lines and no tables. They definitely have a lack of inside dining options at this particular park (Animal Kingdom seemed pretty bad too but we didn't even try to have lunch there). 

We really wish we had known about the Sci-Fi dine in theater before coming here. Would have been willing to spend some money for a fun lunch. Unfortunately, it was completely booked up.",Overpriced mediocrity at its finest. Disney taking advantage of hungry people stuck in a park that are willing to pay way more than they need to for bottom of the barrel food.,130,1
Bamboo Garden Super Buffet,3125 Columbia Blvd,2.5,"Was there last night about 630, food was fresh, service was good. Good variety. Can't complain about anything. We will go back",This buffet is great. Ate there last Wednesday. Food was very fresh and plentiful. Mongolia BBQ is very good.,"NEVER had a problem here and we eat here once or twice a month, service ok food usually good and have the sushi each and every time and never a problem....",The owner sucks she used to own bamboo garden on US-1 they made her close it down and she bought the one on 50. Her and her husband have always been rude to me and my husband. They never clear off the table they never refill drinks. She yelled at my husband because he left food on his plate because it was old food and charged him extra. I was 8 months pregnant the last time I went to their restraunt I asked if they could turn the fan on and they said no because of the electricity bill. They all just stare at us like we don't belong there. Every time it's a problem. Before we checked out on Thursday they have candy for you to grab when you leave so I grab 4 one for me my husband and two kids and she snatched the bucket of candy and put it behind the counter and said NO .I'm a server so I know people live off of tips but I'm sorry you don't even approach me with your name and talk to me like a regular waitress should then you yell at me about FREE candy. Way to go. Hopefully somebody else takes over.,Awful. We went early on a Sunday evening. No one was there but the buffet was FULL so you know that stuff had been sitting out. Food that should have been hot was cold and vice versa.  The meats were dry - either from being overcooked or from sitting out. My in-laws said they had positive experiences before but it had really declined.,"I went into Bamboo Garden on June 7th, this was my first time ever trying this establishment and I honestly the business owner is a terrible person. They have below average sushi and this isn't even a rant. I'm being totally honest cause I'm a straight up guy. So straight up I tried everything I thought I'd liked and it wasn't even like I picked up a lot of food cause I read the reviews soo I just wanted to test it out and see if it was good or not and when I realized that it was terrible food (A lot of it was cold, and just not delicious at all) I just told the lady that I just didn't like the food and it wasnt good and that I only nibbled off the food to which she replied that ""she ain't at fault for the food being nasty, and I cannot make this up, she proceeds to eat off my plate and say that it tastes good to her. I asked her for a discount cause I ain't nothing and she kept saying no, then I asked for a dollar off and she said that if I wasn't going to pay the full price that she'll call the cops and then I paid the full price and just walked out. Please save your money, terrible management and even worse food !",11,1
Biergarten Restaurant,1510 Ave Of The Stars,4.0,"YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM!!!!

This is a super delicious German buffet.  You are seated at a table with another family there for the buffet (tables seat 8), you order your drinks, and then off you go--time to eat!!  Amazing entertainment, too!

Don't go when the park is super busy, though (i.e. Thanksgiving), as you'll end up waiting in line for the buffet.  Boo.","If you are looking for dinner with entertainment this place comes highly recommended! You will likely be sat with another party, similar to traditional German beer halls but everything else here delivers what you'd expect from a Disney restaurant!

If you are traveling with the family it is a huge advantage that they have a small dance floor area, be aide let me tell you, the kids out there, they were in their glory!

Aside from the entertainment I found the food to be both authentic and high quality, two things that are often hard to pull of in a buffet venue. The staff is extremely friendly, service is phenomenal and the food is delicious.

One specific tip here is to take one of the Wiener sausages and have it with a side of curry ketchup, this is something like curry wurst served I. Germany and can be quite good.

You really can't go wrong with this place, the price isn't cheap but they deliver a ton of quality, a great atmosphere and amazing service.

It is well worth eating here! I highly recommend making a reservation",Always amazing! Sitting with a different family is weird at first but we really enjoyed our new friends. All the food is delicious and the entertainment is fun and authentic! Never been disappointed!!!!,"BUFFET ONLY! This experience was terrible. We had no idea idea this place was buffet only and that we were required to have at least 4 people to get the buffet. All we wanted was beer and apps. So since we had already got our beers we were stuck, we has to get the buffet. So expensive for what we got. And all we wanted was beer.",Food wasn't that good. Had to wait in long like for small buffet. Had to share a table with another family which isn't cool. I was just mad at the whole experience. But the beer was good so,"Not worth the money. Food was mediocre.
 Empty buffet dishes were not restocked. 
 I couldnt even get the ONE thing I really wanted, a pretzel roll,
 because staff did not refill bread baskets.
Apple strudel served warm was hard, crunchy, and dry.
Very disappointed :(",601,1
Boi Brazil Churrascaria,5600 International Dr,4.0,"Watch out Texas de Brazil and Fogo de Chao, you got serious competition at Boi Brazil, I was very surprised, in a really good way, for the quality of the meat, great customer service, prices are amazing for the type of food served; they are saving smart! you may not have the mash potato side and the labels to indicate if you want the guys to serve more meat but that does not even matter because they are so aware of you as a customer that you really don't need to have a green or red label in your table, the salad bar is fresh and delicious, another smart move: they don't have things that you won't eat at a Brazilian Churrascaria. I have a new place to eat in Orlando, I hope they open in Miami soon!!!!! Try their flan, it's amazing!","Ligamos antes para reservar no restaurante, fomos atendido pelo Alexandre que foi tão gentil e resolvemos conhecer, ao chegar o atendimento foi melhor ainda.
Preço justo e alta qualidade!!!
Sensacional!!!","We live in Daytona and we were craving some Brazilian food, we usually have Texas de Brazil but wanted to try something new. BoiBrazil was definitely different, in a good way! 
When you first go in, you realize it's much calmer than Texas de Brazil and they greet you as soon as you come through the door! Food was amazing. Some might say it's better than TdB. Personally, I think it was better, because they try to give you a variety of Brazilian type foods. If you're really into the veggies, you probably won't care much for it. If you end up having space for dessert I recommend the flan, it was very delicious and had that homemade touch to it. 
Of course everything has space for improvement and the only thing I could think of was the change of waiters. Not that they were rude, (very nice gentlemen) I just didn't know who I was tipping in the end. 
Overall great place to bring family and friends!","I had great expectations after reading all these reviews, but they failed me miserably. 
For starters, the caipirinha was good. Made exactly how a caipirinha should be made. Now the service on the other hand....  servers from the beginning seemed very uninterested to say the least. Came to check on the table maybe once during the whole meal. 
Salad bar was mediocre at best, the restaurant was empty -- there were only two tables sat in the whole restaurant. I only had one good piece of picanha during my whole dinner. All other pieces and meats were not too good. Im very disappointed. 
The reason I am giving one star is because I asked for the bill without even being full. I am sad that this place is failing, as I see all the potential here. But It pretty much ruined the rest of my night. I felt like I threw money away.",Just horrible went with my mother and all I stared at for a long time was al bundy with his hands in his pants standing next to the bar. Food was horrible. And nobody spoke English wtf. Never returning again,If you have any sense you will not eat here! Don't know how they are in business.! The food is salty the meat is tough- the salad bar sucks - was the only late night place open- wish I had not gone in at all - should have walked out when first walked in. It was so hot in the restaurant. The tables are on top of each other and the the bathroom was dirty. Should have left at that point. I already had a bad feeling,374,1
Boston Lobster Feast,8731 International Dr,3.0,"This was a surprisingly great experience and kid friendly. We're regular patrons at Joe's Crab Shack and decided to try something different based on the positive yelp reviews.  The math works out roughly the same too.  We arrived around 3pm yesterday (2/18) there was a 5-10 minute wait, the saff immediately greeted at the door, upon being seated our waitress Swaizy gave us the break down. Adults are $45 per person. Our 7 year old was $15 not including the drink or tip and our toddler was free. 

There's something for everyone in their buffet selection.  The salad, vegetables, cold seafood, lobster, snow crab legs, salmon, lobster bisque and prime rib were all deliciously fresh and full of flavor. Several repeat customers I spoke to had excellent things to say.  Our 7 lobsters were cooked perfectly. My husbands favorite was the blackened salmon. I loved the prime rib. The lobster bisque was a bit too salty for my taste but they didn't skimp on the chunks of lobster in it. The kids enjoyed ice cream and my 7yr old had the greatest time for her bithday dinner. All she's wanted was lobster and enjoyed all 4 of hers lol. 

Our waitress Swaizy was amazing and great about checking in on us especially with it being a full house. The manager Andy also stopped by and chatted for a moment.  Without hesitation I'd recommend BLF to friends and family.  Dress casually & bring your appetite.  Tip: The back room is quiet and intimate compared to the main dining area for 4 people or less.","After many trips to Orlando I had finally managed to eat here as I love seafood. My son does as well. This is a pretty good assortment of seafood. But the one steak item I had was also very good. Arrived late after all day at Lego land and there was no waiting. There was still plenty of food items on the buffet. I had two lobsters, one was medium and the second was quite large. My son ate two as well. Our lobsters all appeared to have just been steamed as they were very juicy. They did have the claws on them. My son loved his and might have eaten more but I said he could only have two. The other items I ate were the Mahi Mahi, which was decent but by the time I arrived had set out in the warming tray to long. A lot of the cold shrimp which were great. The snow crab legs, there were claws at first but later just leg sections. The snow crab were quite good as well. The pasta with white sauce and scallops was pretty good too if you want something other than the lobster. The fried shrimp was decent as well if you like fried seafood they had all of those items, but I didn't want to fill up on that. Surprisingly they also had sausage in tomato sauce with peppers and onions which was also pretty good. Plenty of raw clams, oysters etc. Good smoked salmon both cold and hot. Seafood salad was good as was a crab and cheese bake. They had other items like rolls prime rib, mashed potatoes, and soup but I decided to focus on the lobster and crab and try some other items. Overall a great value if you like seafood and in particular lobsters and or crab. Not going to be somewhere to go if you are not hungry. I also liked most all the deserts, they are smaller but at that point that is all you will be able to eat. The ice cream at the i drive location is hidden behind the restrooms.

The service was very good, they gave us refills quickly, and removed all plates and bowls of discarded shells very quickly, even brought out some french fries for the kids which is one item not on the buffet. I would go back again when in Orlando.",If you love lobsters then this is the place for you.  The lobsters were great. Raw oysters were good and the shrimp dishes were great too. The service was fantastic also.,We walk right when it just open. Left over crab legs and lobsters from the day before. Probably others foods are left over too. Not much selection on the buffer line. Lobster are tiny. Only one lobster per dish so don't let the review pictures that people have multiple lobster on their dish trick you. Over price and under cook!,My boyfriend has eaten here before and liked it. We ate here on a Monday night and had food poisoning all night and the next day. We are here on vacation and it ruined our day. The people who work there are very nice! The food was okay but not worth the $45 price and sickness. Im from Maryland where there is amazing seafood and this was not even close to good for the cost.,"DO NOT GO HERE!! The food was terrible (bland, luke warm) and this place is way over priced! After eating here, I became very sick to my stomach!! I can think of a million other ways to spend $162!! (2 adults & 3 kids). We will NEVER visit this place ever again!!",774,1
Breakfast with Goofy and his Pals,10100 Dream Tree Blvd,5.0,Kids?  Then you just have to do this.  It's a riot.  See for yourself.  Worth the cost for a kids adventure they will talk about for years.,"We are staying at Four Seasons Hotel from Wednesday to Sunday. We took advantage of their breakfast with Goofy & friends ( only Thursday and Saturday 7:30-11 AM). It's cheap $45 for all you can eat buffet. I say cheap because you get your entertainment ! Fun & Friendly Disney characters ( Mickey, Minnie and Goofy ) visited each table for photo sessions. Each character is accompanied by a professional photographer & PR person / body guard. Food is eatable for adults & kids friendly.  I stuffed myself with salmon, capers and Italian deli... bowl of blueberries, raspberries and strawberries . Divine !","I am so happy i found this character breakfast in yelp.   I have been to several disney character breakfast inside the park and at the contemporary hotel.    I was hoping something a little better that those because of these reviews but ""Goofy and his pals"" exceeded our expectations.    Food was excellent, service was great from the hostess, servers, characters.... We are so happy the characters took the time for the pictures and went to our table many times.   First time i can honestly say we had breakfast with the characters.","I took my daughter to Goofy's Kitchen in California, and had a great time when she was a teenager!  I wanted my grandchildren to have the same fun while in Orlando so we made a reservation for Breakfast with Goofy at the Four Seasons.  I have never had so much confusion with a reservation!  Originally I had made it online, but called the location to see if we could get a later time.  They were very accommodating, however, my reservation time never changed in the app for our visit to Disney World.  I continued getting emails regarding the initial time of 8:45 a.m. so when my husband couldn't make the family vacation due to work, I called to reduce our party for our 9:30 a.m. reservation.  The next email I received indicated that reservation had been cancelled!  Once again I called, and was assured that we still had a reservation.  Needless to say, I was a little apprehensive upon our arrival . . . 

I guess you're suppose to know that the Bloody Mary's and Mimosas are bottomless.  Apparently the pricing is on a blackboard as you enter at the juice bar.  We hadn't read this board since we were seated almost immediately.  My daughter and I both ordered Bloody Mary's, but I requested tequila in mine (I don't drink Vodka).  The server told me she'd have to check, but never mentioned that the Vodka version was bottomless and mine with tequila would not be.  Had we been given this information while ordering, we both would have opted for the Mimosa's!  

I am not a big fan of buffets simply because I don't eat enough to justify the price.  However, I had an excellent omelette; and there was an assortment of cheeses and fresh fruit to accompany.  Definitely no complaints regarding the food selection and quality!

Photos of your interaction with the characters is included in the price.  However, the only ""professional"" photographer trails behind Goofy; and there are none taken with Minnie or Mickey.  In addition, I would expect a professional to get a decent picture of your group instead of taking a couple of candids where people are unaware; and therefore, not looking at the camera.  We were a party of four, and we don't have one picture that includes us all!  Rather disappointing since this was our first (and possibly only) Breakfast with Goofy.  Neither of the grandchildren were excited about the characters LOL",Kids?  Then you just have to do this.  It's a riot.  See for yourself.

Buffet City,4551 13th St,3.0,"Greatest Chinese All You Can Eat Restaurant in St Cloud..., a huge variety of all kinds of Food... a little something for everybody ..... I do miss the Old Ice Cream Machine......Sushi Display is Excellent.... lots of parking. A++++",awesome food! you cant get good sushi for that price! a hidden gem for chinese food and sushi lovers!,"This place is fantastic! The food is tasty, people are friendly and the Sushi bar has a wide variety of delicious treats!!",I hate to give such a low rating to a hometown restaurant. I was shocked by how the quality of the food has declined in the last 2 years. There is plenty of selection with a lot of variety however everything I had was below average in taste in quality.  Lunch was $8.65 without a drink. It is definitely below average when compared with other Chinese buffet. I would not recommend it.,"Came here again for dinner last night.  When we were done with our meal, we asked the waitress for our bill.  She brought the bill and we immediately handed her our credit card to take to pay the bill.  A couple minutes later, she brought back the receipt for us to sign, and stood there beside our table holding our credit card and our copy of the receipt until after we put our tip down and signed the receipt.  We felt it was very off putting and uncomfortable for us to have the waitress stand there at our table hovering over us while we put the tip amount down and sign the receipt, and then holding our credit card hostage until after we did the tip and sign the receipt.  I dont know of any other normal restaurant that this happens in.  We will not return here until this behavior is corrected.",All I have to say is DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!! I feel filthy after eating here!!! We ate here before few years ago so we decided to stop by last night oh man never again!!

Cafe Gauguin,9840 International Dr,3.0,"We came here for a business lunch with clients during a conference at the hotel.  It was horribly decorated--it looked like a scene from the cafe on Saved By The Bell (The Max)!

BUT the service was amazing--friendly and fast.  And the buffett was really good.  Extensive, the food was full and fresh and tasty!

Highly recommend!",This is such a wonderful place to go for the Holiday Brunches.  The food is simply put it magnificent.   The staff is beyond great.  We had Scott waiting on us and he really went out of his way to accommodate my mother which really meant a lot to her.  They always go above and beyond.  It is worth the price because you get high quality food that is always fresh.  Not the greasy stuff that is usually in buffets.  Best to make reservations a few weeks in advance to get the best location and seating time that you want.,"Thanksgiving buffet has been fantastic! The food is plentiful and a large variety! Something for everyone of every age! Servers all have a smile, even tho they are working the holiday. Well done holiday buffet!",The buffet is 17 dollars and the variety is like the free breakfast at Super8. The food was out for a long time and cold.,"I'm feeling generous this morning giving Cafe Cauguin (1) star. First of all, when the hostess sat me down, no one came to ask me if I wanted to order. 15 minutes later, I was was blessed with ""service."" I asked if I could see a menu. They don't have menus. The ONLY option is a buffet or eggs to order. I ordered 3 eggs whites and got 3 pieces of bacon from the buffet. I also order 1 cup of coffee. The eggs whites were dry and rubbery. The bacon was average. The coffee was good. Total bill including mandatory 18% service charge was over $23.00. Let me get this straight. 1. No menus. 2. Medicocre food. 3. No service with a mandatory service charge.  This  restaurant will never get my business again and I promise to share my story with a lot of people. Disappointed for a hotel of this caliber is an understatement. HINT: Watch what Marriott does, you can learn a LOT from them.","Had my morning breakfast from here. The eggs were runny, the bacon was soft, the sausages were the worst! It all tasted very nasty. For $21.00, I was ripped off. The server was tentative but was not worth the mandatory 18% included on the billing but understand that if tip is based on the quality of food here no one would leave a tip!  

They do have a good assortment of fruit.",49,1
Cafe Matisse,9700 International Dr,3.0,"Very good food, good dervice, and reasonable price. The buffet is not extensive but uou get the prime rib, and 2 or 3 other proteins, good salad bar, and good sides.
You also get 5 different desserts and ice cream
They have a good 25% discount coupon on the website of the hotel.","This is one of Orlando's best kept secrets.  Cafe Matisse is inside the Rosen plaza Hotel.  It is a buffet style restaurant.  

I have dined here several times, I am surprised I've never had the opportunity to give it a review on Yelp!

Every year the Knights of Columbus have huge event here right after Thanksgiving Day.  I usually participate in this event.  

My wife and I went on Friday evening to check out the hospitality suite.  We really did not like the selection of food that they had there.  So we went downstairs to Café Matisse.

I was promptly greeted by the hostess, she informed me that the Knights of Columbus were being given a  25% discount on the buffet. Did I mention the buffet includes prime rib?  I was all over it.

I approach the prime rib carving station, to notice that the prime rib had already been pre-sliced.  The man at the carving station asked me, ""Would you like two?""  I said, ""no I'll just have one to start.""  I should've taken his advice, I wound up making three trips.  My wife and another guest both had a lot of seafood, which they enjoyed.  They kept raving about the Mac and cheese.  I tried some, it was very good.  Overall the food was good, the service was good. 

Just a word of caution... Pay close attention to your bill, the tip is automatically added on.  Even after I swiped my credit card, and credit card machine prompted me if I wanted to add a tip.","Cafe Matisse is another Rosen buffet (like Cafe Gauguin at the Rosen Center).  This buffet is smaller than Cafe Gauguin, but also pretty good.  I would say it's better than any other buffet type restaurant you can find on International Drive.  (10x better than Ponderosa or Golden Corral).

The buffet is not open every day.  It varies depending on if conventions are in town, or if the hotel occupancy is high.  I definitely suggest calling prior to going to see if the buffet is open, and if so, what they are having.

I often will call Cafe Matisse and then call Cafe Gauguin to see what each is serving, and make a decision based on menu.

For Orlando residents, they participate in the Orlando Entertainment Book, making it an even better value - for buy one-get one free buffets.  Definitely a GREAT deal then.

On holidays, Cafe Matisse offers expansive buffets (that are delicious).  You must make a reservation for them (Easter, Christmas, Thanksgiving), as they sell out quickly.","My family and I had lunch here on Saturday before visiting ICE! at nearby Gaylord Palms.  Very poor selection and quality of food.  18% tip automatically added to bill.  For 3 people for a buffet lunch, with taxes and tip, total was just under $50.  The quality of food was equivalent to Golden Corral.  Would not recommend this place.",Worst breakfast buffet over priced and tip included at 18. Percent for only 2 people and its serve yourself it was $34 for us and the bar is Skippy with a lot of breads and things to fill you up. The best part was the omelet made to order. Hotel is great this place sucks,I went to the breakfast buffett. The coffee had a large piece of something floating in it. My strawberry had a dead caterpillar in it. Then I was given a free  meal and 25% off the remaining 2 people's bills. However an 18% gratuity was mandatory added on the whole bill and no one mentioned I was supposed to get a 50% off anyway for staying at the hotel. The manager asked my room number so I guess they used that to make the numbers work for them.  The highlight of the meal was the eggs. The pancakes were not very good and the bacon was dry.,29,1
Café Osceola,9939 Universal Blvd,3.5,"Yep...five stars.   Although this is a belated Easter Buffet review, it warranted writing.   My wife and I are from Louisville KY (and Rhode Island) so we were heading to Florida to visit our daughter for Easter.  Where to eat?  Tons of choices at all price levels.  The Cafe's Easter Menu looked intriguing plus our daughter would receive a resident discount so what the heck!

We arrived at the beautiful property and were quickly greeted by the friendly valet staff.  They whisked our car away and we headed in.  Hmmm Café Ocseola - figuring we'd soon be in some typical breakfast venue but as we turned the corner out of the elevator - wow.   What an amazing albeit gigantic place!   There were tables and booths all tastefully done with upholstered seats.  The linen tablecloths and fresh flowers meant business - this was not a diner!

Our waitress Zebrina arrived from the waitress station with Champagne and Mimosas in hand!  My wife and I opted for a mid-morning mimosa and Chelsea said just water - to which I said 'I'll drink hers!'  Not so classy but free bubbles?  Come on!  Little did I know that throughout the meal, the refills of champagne and mimosas would come so frequently that we had to raise the surrender flag!   We don't even drink and we downed 3 or so delicious drinks - made with what seemed like fresh OJ.

I had to get up and go.  I like to peruse buffets before I eat.  Sometimes I tend to 'fluff up' the food that has been sitting there for the morning. NOT HERE!  There were individual stations at every turn and all fresh and well attended  by the professional kitchen staff.  All were friendly and courteous to us as they worked and we edged our way to the serving spoons.

I headed toward the cured meats, cheeses and assorted roasted veggie display - yes display because it wasn't food plopped onto trays - it was a work of art!   And to seal the deal - a Parmesan Jesus!  Yes our savior carved into a wheel of cheese.  Our daughter's boyfriend named him ""CHEESE-US'.  The options were too numerous to count.  The meats were thinly sliced and arranged aside at least 10 types of cheeses.  Plus there were mini-canapés and veggies and omg I do not recall what else! There was another cheese carving - maybe an Eagle but who knows exactly, I was staring at the food by then.

My wife and I are big Asian eaters - all types of food; especially Chinese Dim Sum and Japanese Sushi.   Wham - the next turn had a 10-foot table of bamboo steamer baskets filled with Dim Sum dumplings, Kim Chee, Sushi, noodles and pork belly!  I grabbed my chopsticks and went for it.

Behind that was a paella pan the size of a round coffee table!  Of course it's rice but it was filled with meats and seafood including fresh shellfish - clams and mussels. It was great.  There were cold tables with various salads and prepared dishes beside it as well.

Honestly, there was a array of roast beef, pork, fish and other hot dishes but who cared - there were too many wonderfully different items to eat.  Leave the meat and potatoes for somebody else.  My daughter said it was great.  I didn't have space.

Finally we found these hand crafted chocolate bunnies.  Not your Russell Stover type but colossal ghost buster sized bunnies that owned the dessert table!  The treats ranged from pies to small cakes, puddings and chocolate decadence.  There was a chocolate fountain - not the Golden Corral Chocolate Fountain that you are afraid to put your spoon under - but a velvety warm chocolate with fruits and cake and stuff - OH MY!  Then there were these little square shot glass sized items that looked like pudding in, well it must have been six to eight different colors. The chef behind the display said it was different types of fruit and flavored cheesecakes!  What? I'm having fun and learned something too!  (Big Bang 2015!),

I can't say where I ended my day but certainly with a piece of pastry and a cup of coffee, all the while Zebrina was by to pick up our plates, clean the table cloth and offer us more bubbly.  We looked at the clock and we easily filled two hours of our Easter morning.   

We paid our check - discount and all - and headed out.  I don't believe we stopped talking about the fabulous meal for days.  Everyone we talked to hear about 'Cheese-us' but also about the incredible food and presentations and did I say incredible food and service and atmosphere.

The Café Osceola Easter buffet was not cheap or for the faint of heart. It takes a commitment to eating to get through it.  But we loved it. LOVED IT.  

We are heading down this weekend to visit Chelsea again (shhh don't tell her but we are REALLY coming for the Sunday Brunch at the Café!) and will visit Shingle Creek.

We've also are making reservations for Mother's Day and will be asking for friendly, professional Zebrina again. I hope she is working!

Thanks for a great day!  Michael, Sherry and Chelsea","I had previously written a much longer note than this so I'm just giving fellow Yelpers an update.  We have visited Café Osceola and been served by Zebrina twice since our Easter visit.

The next time was their normal Sunday brunch.   Normal isn't really a fair word for this place.  After experiencing Easter, you'd think this experience wouldn't match up.  Certainly this was the eggs and bacon and French toast selection but to be fair, at almost $50 less per person, it again was a great experience!   Zebrina was great, always attentive and we love chatting with her.  Never overbearing, just nice and ensures we are always well taken care of.

We were just there on Sunday for Mother's Day.  Bravo - another fantastic experience.  Very similar to the Easter Buffet but with it's own twists, we were overwhelmed by the variety and wonderfully prepared dishes.  Zebrina was there again (she must be getting tired of seeing us!) and did a wonderful job.   The displays were beautiful, the food was hot and fresh and so tasty and the staff was smiling and sweet and were there with whatever we needed.

Mr. Rosen swung through again offering my wife a Happy Mother's day.  Zebrina gave my wife Sherry the pretty plant from the table (if this gets her in trouble - SHE DIDN'T DO IT! lol). which we'll be sure to plant.

So that's it.  I can't wait to go back again.  The next time we need to stay at the resort.  I really hate to leave!

Mike","We had the breakfast buffet two days in a row and we loved it!!!!  Simo was our server, he was friendly and attentive. We were staying at the Rosen and really enjoying our stay. The fresh fruit was incredible, I've never seen berries so big and sweet. The chef who made our omelette did a wonderful job, he was very generous with fillings. This buffet is definitely a repeat","This is worst buffet i have ate in a long time.  The lettuce was not filled for five min, the shrimp was old and the prime rib was the end piece.  Then went back to try a second round of prime rib and it was not even cooked.   So the guy put a piece on a grill and it was burnt.   I then went back for dessert and they had three items out but had 8 signs for dessert.  

Would not recommend for dinner Buffett","The food was not very hot on the buffet. the server ask if things were alright,we siad not really. but instead of offering something 
else,she insisted on deserts.  Not worth 25.00 per person on a limited buffet at this price. do not waste your time or money on this restaurant.","Our Group arrives with the US Chess Federation (around 5000 attendees)
The first day we were quoted a price 8.95 by the waiter (ABUEL) for BREAKFAST BUFFET but when we went back it was $17.95! with a 18% tip per check, we were two checks so the waiter received a 36% tip!!!! ON 1 TABLE. Its no wonder they were pushing the buffet instead of the menu, as a matter of a fact they did not even give us a menu they sat us and said help our selves at the buffet.
We instead on telling the US CHESS FEDERATION about our experience and recommended a different location to have our National chess tournament. We will definitely NOT RECOMMEND Cafe Osceola...unless you don't mind getting ripped off and the manager of the restaurant Danny Salsa or the Hotel manager Kenny seemed to be surprised with my complaint.",59,1
Chef Mickey's,4600 World Dr,3.5,Yeay!!! Kids and grand kids had a great meal! nana was pleasantly surprised at how tasty and delicious her salmon was and the kids had fun taking horoscope with the characters... All in all a GREAT time... Worth the trip!!!,"Probably one of my favorite meals we did this whole trip. I totally get that it's for families and kids, but when you are on the dining plan and you can have buffet breakfast, why turn that down? We had an 11:05 reservation and we ended up being late because the weather was HORRIBLE this day. They still ended up honoring our reservation no questions asked. The restaurant is in the Contemporary Resort which was beautiful in itself, which automatically made the restaurant awesome. The brunch buffet is ENORMOUS and there is so much to choose from. Everything was fresh and delicious and I wanted my own recipe of the cheesy breakfast potatoes to take home with me! Our waitress was great as was all of the staff at this restaurant. We got to meet the fab five in a timely manner so we weren't stuck there waiting all day to meet them. All in all this restaurant is very cool!","We've dined here 4 times now, and I'm finally just now getting around to doing a review (and we'll be back here in December!!)

This is a MUST for each Disney vacation. We just can't help it.

There's a little bit of everything for all tastes - and the characters come around to your table to sign autographs and pose for pictures. They do a little dance, napkin spin thing every once in awhile and that's fun.

It is loud - so if you are looking for a nice quiet dinner, this is not for you.",PRICEY. LOUD. BUSY. That is how I would describe this restaurant for dinner when we went one evening at around 8 at night. Our reservation was for 8:00 P.M. But they did not seat us till 8:20 which was annoying as you could clearly tell they tried to book as many reservations as possible. Food was good soup was also good (New England clam chowder). Desserts were fine but weren't replenished very quickly or at all which is frustrating if you are paying 50 per person. Even though this was a character meal Minnie never made it to our table and there is no system in place to make sure a character visits each table which means it was a free for all with kids running up to characters and running all along the buffet line that I was almost tripped a couple times. My suggestion is to see the characters in the park and have a nice quiet meal at one of the other nice Disney restaurants I feel this is not worth almost 50 per person.,"Three words: ""Just say no."" ""Don't do it"" would also suffice. The food was ok - hit and miss on the buffet, as with most buffets. The difference? I spent well over $200 for a family of five to eat basically Western Sizzlin with Disney characters. Since kids 10+ are adults in this fantasy world, 2 of my 3 kids (by everyone else's definition of the word) cost the full adult price. Not so magical Disney.",Horrible food. All the food in the buffet was lukewarm. Everytging I picked tasted like it had been sitting way too long. Had to ask twice for the characters to stop at our table. The price is ridiculous. Our waiter was exceptional. That is honestly the only positive thing I can say.,575,1
Cici's Pizza 1,7437 International Dr,2.5,"An excellent place to visit for all you can eat Pizza for around $5 !!


 Excellent variety of pizzas, always fresh - along with a selection of pasta, salad and desserts.


 Look around for 10% off coupons in most Florida publications for an additional discount, off the already excellent price.


 Located on International Drive, it is extremely easy to get to - if you use the i-ride trolley, there is a stop almost directly outside.


 Definitely check it out !","The best pizza I have ever tasted. Freshly made, there is a great buffet selection of al types of pizza available. You pay about $4.50 and then its all you can eat.
You can have pasta, salad, pizza and desserts - all included in the price. Also if they don have out a pizza you are after you can ask and they will make one for you there and then, taking about half an hour at most. The pizza is so fresh, you can see them making it over the counter. Its so cheap, tasty and filling. Anyone please go to this restaurant!
I wish they would come over to the u.k. PLEASEEEEEEEE!!","What can I say? It's just... Too much ahahha, the first time I ate there I was in heaven!!! Pizza and brownies??!!! LOVED IT!! if you want something YUM and for a very good price you should go to cici 's, one of my favorite places ... Seriously THE BROWNIES!! AMAZING!! lol",First time my family and I were trying this place... it was not good at all!!! The service/workers were rude and not helpful. The food was low quality and very few choices. The pasta was crusty and the salad bar looked old. I would not come back again.,Es ist billig und so schmeckt es auch. Jetzt weiss ich auch warum so viele Amis mehr als dick sind.,"Um Gottes Willen.

Cici's Pizza 2,"11701 International Dr, Ste 2200",2.5,"Best Cici's I've ever been to. Large, clean, attentive and friendly staff, well-stocked buffet. Will come here again!","This is a super nice CiCi's establishment, very clean and presentable. Went for a late lunch, so it wasn't busy. But the pizza was all hot and fresh! This was one of the best CiCi's experiences I've had.",The best Cicis Pizza!!!! Outstanding customer service from the moment that you arrive. Roxy rocks!!!! Super clean and fresh!!! Must come back!,"Wow, I remember why I never eat at CiCi's!  This isn't pizza!  Can't believe they're still in business.  Nothing against this particular location, CiCi's is just awful in general.  What a waste of money!  Most of the sodas in the soda machine are flat.  Ordered the wings and it looks like they're pan fried, with the Buffalo sauce on the side.  Again, can't believe this chain is still in business!  We will NEVER waste another penny at a CiCi's restaurant.","This Cicis was the worst pizza place I have ever been to. The pizza was rubbery, cold and really greasy. The wings that we ordered didn't come out until we had almost finished eating AND the sauce was on the side in a very small container. The so called pasta was cold, rubbery and had absolutely no flavor. The salad was limp and yellow that looked rotten and old. Now let's discuss the service. My party had to move two tables together because there was a lot of us and after we moved them we received an extremely dirty look from an employee. Even when we told her that we would move the tables back to their original spots, like we had planned on doing, she was still very unpleasant. The tables were also sticky and not properly cleaned. I had been to the Cicis in San Antonio and many other in the area, so I was disappointed with what I had found. Will definitely not be returning to this establishment. 10/10 would not recommend, unless rubbery pizza, flavorless pasta and bad service is your idea of a good meal.","We came to the restaurant tonight and I had a problem, the pizza was ok (not what I was expecting), we were eating and the pasta was like reheated; as well as the pizza. Then we ordered wings to see if we could get a better taste from the restaurant and It was worse than the pizza and the pasta, as a result of it, we decide to ask for a refund for the wings and they didn't want to do the refund because we gave a lite bite to the wings. I had to wait like 20 minutes and then the manager came out from the kitchen and finally talked to me, I thought that she was going to do the refund immediately but no, she was talking with the person who took my order instead of talk to me to solve the problem. After that, they finally did the refund but just in a half. 

Very disappointed of the service and food.

Cici's Pizza 3,5035 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy,3.0,"Walking in we were greeted with a friendly smile and a boisterous ""welcome to Cici's!"" We were able to get our local residents discount and we were quickly on our way to hot fresh delicious pizza on the buffet. 

The special limited pizza they are offering right now is the Bacon Cheddar Pizza that I have been anxiously waiting to try, because it has two of my most favorite things. Cheese and bacon. Well I was not disappointed. It was hot and ready and plentiful. Never once was the try on the buffet empty. As far as the taste of the pizza went, it was just as I expected. No pizza sauce to get in the way, just bacon and cheesy goodness. 

The best part is that I had my favorite alfredo pasta to go along with it. I was a little nervous with it being a Holiday that this place would be crazy and they would have trouble keeping up with the flow of customers but they exceeded my expectations.

Bravo Cici's!","Great family restaurant! Prices are affordable, pizza was great and the salad bar had a good variety. The employees were also really friendly and the manager went out of his way to make our visit extra special. Would definitely eat here again if we are in the area!","Had a coupon for buy one adult pizza buffet get one free. Took our family of 7 after going to Disney. It was less than $40 for all of us, two being children. They had a great salad bar that had very fresh vegetables on it. The pizza was fresh and great. They kept it rolling out. The restaurant was very clean as well as the restrooms. The people working there were also very friendly. Just a great meal after spending tons of money all week on so so food.","Went to CiCi's 1st time ever! Get in your car turn around head down 2 blocks to the Golden Coral the Lunch price is the same! You can even get pizza there too. Salad bar is 10X way better,fresher and safer than CiCi's! I was hoping it would be decent Sorry it's NOT!","If you're hungry for Cici's, you know what you're in for, but trust me, hit a different location.  It's overpriced at $7.99 for the buffet and the guy running the place charges 50 cents for a to go cup on top of everything.  One person at Cici's should not cost $12.  That's just insane.  This particular Cici's is on 192 in a tourist trap.  The restaurant is in a plaza and is open into a gift shop, the kind that sells shirts for $5.  The other wall is a discount attractions ticket vendor.  Seriously.  As far as the food goes, perhaps the kitchen staff were being lazy because, despite three large families with kids in the restaurant, the pizza out was all dry.  When they DID eventually put out fresh food, it was sub par to other locations in the area.  Cici's is fine for what it is, but trust me, avoid this one.",It takes a lot of work to make pizza terrible.  This place did it.  The drink machines smelt like mildew and the ice in the drinks made my throat burn.  STAY AWAY!,56,1

And place was very clean and food was delicious . One of the best cici pizza franchise ive ever been.",I was so excited to finally eat at Cici's and it didn't disappoint. This is another cheap meal option during your Disney vacation. They have cheesy garlic bread pizza which I think is really amazingly delicious. Also the pasta salad was good too. I didn't notice until the last day of my vacation that on the back of the receipt there's a survey that can get you a $4 buffet.,"First, plates small cups, forks were not clean.... dirty..   restroom smell pretty bad... very skimpy toppings...  also pricy at $6.99 adult buffet + $1.99 drink.

Staffs response about complaints: The dishes (all of them) had a film of crust of food on them. The manager was there and I took two plates to him and showed him that a butter knife could scrape off all the nasty layered contaminates off the plates. He apologized and blamed the dish washer for not using some liquid that is supposed to wash the plates clean. I went back to see the plates and non were removed and still were contaminated.

Covington Mill Restaurant,1751 Hotel Plaza Blvd,4.0,"Great Lunch, great service, friendly and perfect service from our waitress, Erin! Perfect ""Create an Omelet"", $16. And, ""Chicken Tikka Masala"", $22. Don't let the casual atmosphere fool you, the food is delicious! We will return. Thank you.",We had breakfast here while staying at the Hilton. The pancakes were AMAZING! Eggs were delicious. No powdered eggs here! The second day I had French toast and was NOT disappointed! Sunday the Disney characters come around for hints and photo ops. Definitely recommend this restaurant  for breakfast.,Honestly the breakfast buffet was great! It's a big spread with everything you can think of. For the buffet as long as an adult gets the buffet a child gets buffet for free. Can beat it especially if you are staying in the Hilton,"We are staying at this Hilton hotel and came down for breakfast before we went out to the parks. I had an eggs Benedict and I had to ask for a steak knife to cut through the English muffin and even that felt like I was getting an arm workout. It said it came with asparagus and literally came with just one asparagus. The potatoes definitely came out of a bag. My husband had the egg breakfast with just scrambled eggs, toast, potatoes, and turkey sausage. He said the only very good thing on the plate was the turkey sausage. Everything else was average. The kid's plate was fine with a pancake that had Mickey print in the middle of it so my daughter liked that. I wouldn't have minded this so much except that when we got the bill it was $50 for a less than average breakfast. We should have gone to a diner and had way better food for less than 30 bucks. I have never written a two star review, but this one deserved it.",This is not a quaint local restaurant. It is in the Hilton. We were disappointed as we've been trying to stick to local owned places. Food was acceptable but definitely hotel restaurant prices.  Wasted one breakfast - after we drove here we stayed. Should have in description that it's in the hotel. We would have skipped it.,Not too impressed. Our waiter strongly persuaded us to take the buffet and then we were told they didn't do poached eggs except by service. Staff in general were mediocre.,18,1
Crazy Buffet 1,12237 Orange Blossom Trl,4.0,"The restaurant is very clean , food was hot and fresh. Gloves are provide when you are seated. And more available at the buffet. They are doing great job!","Excellent Chinese buffet, very clean very beautiful inside nice ambience. Friendly servers and staff, clean restrooms","I went yesterday with friends and I love the safety procedures. I feel save!! They gave you gloves to serve yourself. The food was fresh, yummy and very hot!! I love that!! The server was always asking us if we need something! Very clean place!",I think that it is a lack of respect to the client to place a limit of 6 oysters per person on a Saturday at dinner time. The person who opens the oysters is a rude disrespect they should improve the attention to customers.,"I was thinking when I went to this new restaurant that I must be crazy to be going to a buffet while COVID is on the rise.  I was their first customer on the day they opened.  I got there about 5 minutes before they were scheduled to start serving and for a long time I was the only customer.  So yes I was their first customer on day one.

They have different prices for lunch and dinner but since this was Sunday, it was dinner all day, which includes a seafood buffet that has salt and pepper crab legs.  They were really good.  It also features a pho bar where you can pick ingredients they will grill and you spoon broth on top of your selection after the chef has cooked them.  The broth had a spice that did not appeal to me.

They advertise 350 items and have a lot of the items you would expect to find on an Asian buffet.  During the pandemic they have foam plates and bowls and the utensils are sealed plastic ware similar to what is commonly provided with a to go meal.

Pros
  - they are giving everyone gloves and have hand sanitizer
  - fresh and flavorful food although I was there early and my opinion is based on a single visit
  - good sushi including sashimi and rather than having a lot they have selected rolls of high quality
  - service was attentive and my server shared her favorite and suggested items
  - something for everyone.  I also saw mac n cheese, pizza and baked sweet potatoes for kids
Cons
  - they did not seem to be social distancing the tables.  Even though the restaurant was nearly empty they sat a table right next to me.  When I spoke to the manager and mentioned my concern, he did not seem to understand my request.

I am not sure I will go back until the pandemic is over.  I noticed some people were not wearing the gloves and masks at the food bars and the staff were asking them to comply.","The restaurant is very clean , food was hot and fresh.

Crazy Buffet 2,7038 W Colonial Dr,3.5,"This is my favorite Chinese buffet in town now. We were avid Garden Buffet fans until we found this place. We love the huge variety of items and the hibachi is so delicious. We haven't tried their pho yet, but it also looked great. Also the decor is beautiful which just adds another reason for 5 stars.","I love this place for lunch. Their food is delicious, always fresh when I have visited and this restaurant is always clean. The wait staff is very friendly. I look forward to eating here and I don't eat at many buffets. Crazy Good!",Omg...soooo good! The sushi was way better than I expected. The selection is massive. I will definitely come back!,"After reading all the great reviews, I decided to try it out. Went in at 7:45 pm and saw mostly emptied and dried out food. 

All the fish dishes were gone and never refilled. 

All the dim sum were gone. 

Not much selection of sushi and most were leftovers from earlier. The sushi chef just stood behind the counter just cleaning up and didn't make any new sushi. 

There were hardly anything to eat. I felt like why open till 10pm if at 7:45 pm most of the food is gone? 

Overall, there's nothing special about this place.","My wife and I where invited to join family at this restaurant. I had a taste for sushi. After eating about three pieces I became sick. I then went to the bathroom. To try and get myself together. It was filthy. So I went outside for air. I will never ever return. It has been more than 8 hours, and my stomach is still upset.","Hated it! You'd have to be CRAZY to think that anyone could like this place. Yuck. I give this a One Star review because Yelp won't let me leave NO Star reviews! Just bad. So much variety, so little quality. Nothing tastes good, even the desserts are crap. Just yuck. My tip?

Crydermans Barbecue,401 Florida Ave,4.5,I'm a self proclaimed bbq snob and this brisket is some of the best I've had. Ribs so tender you can't pick them up by the bone. So glad they opened for dinner. We will be back.,"By far the best BBQ I've had anywhere in the area. They created a plate for us so we could try everything. We had brisket, ribs, turkey and pulled pork, as well as the Mac and cheese and beans. Absolutely everything was super tender and ate it with a plastic fork. Best brisket I've had outside of Texas and would also get the pulled pork again (I normally say pulled pork is nothing special, but the seasoning on this was!). I'm not a big sauce person so the ribs weren't my favorite but my husband loved them. If in the area, this place is a MUST. But get there early... they close when they sell out!",Absolutely delicious and worth the wait in line! Authentic and tender fall off the bone BBQ ribs! The turkey was seasoned perfectly and juicy. First time there and will not be the last!,"I usually have ribs at any bbq joint. These were tender but had way too much black peppercorns. Indigestion city. The only thing I liked was the smoked turkey. The Mac and cheese had good flavor but they served me the oldest batch. The cheese was starting to curdle.

For $40 I don't think I'll be back. AND I don't mind paying the price for quality foodie food. But I felt ripped off. I could have gone to Sonnys BBQ and had good quality ribs for a fraction of the price. 

Brevard County Taste buds are weak. This is the last time I go by reviews around these parts.",Not a good choice for traditional smoked turkey. I am convinced they are using a precooked deli style turkey breast. No smoked flavor at all and dripping wet. Very disappointing. Than,"Worst smoked turkey I've ever had. It was wet like a precooked deli style cold cut turkey meat. No Smokey taste and it looked just like a PRE packaged precooked cold cut turkey meat.

Curry House Indian Cuisine,11352 S Orange Blossom Trl,4.5,Stopped by because we saw the special for the lunch buffet! I was surprised by the variety of food that was offered! The chicken tikka masala was amazing and flavorful. There was also unlimited butter naan for the buffet and I couldn't get enough of it. Service was great and staff was friendly! Would be stopping by again!,"Curry House was just what we were looking for! A great Indian buffet that had flavorful dishes with a large variety in the buffet. There were plenty of vegetarian dishes and many different types of meat options like chicken biriyani, goat curry, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, and even fish curry! The naan was fresh and paired perfectly with all the delicious curries. The desserts were also so tasty! Service was great and staff was friendly. Can't wait to come back for more.

They were *awesome.*
The place, confirmed by the waitress, was very new. They're trying to figure out how to service and stay alive in these Covid times. We were itchin for Indian (we eat a lot of Indian) and had to have vegetarian options. The all-you-can-eat is great because we can try a lot of things. AYCE Thali? Other than in India, the only place I remember trying with this style was a Gujarati place in NYC (amaaaaazing). So we were excited. We asked about the buffet - nope (nowhere online did it say this). we asked about the AYCE Thali and were handed a separate menu with 2 options. Cool! We order one then are told that one is not available. ARGH - getting frustrated here. We order the other. They also have some Indo-Chinese stuff we like such as Manchurian. So, of course, we grabbed one of those. There was plenty of food on the Thali so we did not have to order a second time. The food was decent - hot, freshly made, and better than average. Would we go back? Sure, especially once the place is fully open. Again, terrific service from the 2 servers - both super super friendly and helpful.",Was looking for a quick bite to eat after a stop at Costco. Drove through this shopping center and found curry house. They seemed to just have opened. My bf and I decided to run in and check it out. They have a regular menu too but on weekends they have lunch buffet. The grand opening special is 10.99 per person. They have your basic typical Indian dishes. Curry and tikka masala. They had a fish curry which was really good. Most places I've been to doesn't seem to serve fish at all in their buffets. There are vegan options as well. They bring you out a basket of naan. Nice and hot. I had a plate and a half of food. There's dessert options and fruits. The service was friendly. The food was good. Not a bad deal!,16,1
El Palacio Buffet 1,909 West Vine St,4.0,"This place is delicious! 12.99 all you can eat OMG! Oxtails, puerro rican pasteles, all types of rice, meat plus empañadas de carne, queso etc. Salad, veggies fruit and ice cream. Still hungry? They have a Chinese food section too! Man I want to eat here everyday. Yum",Love the food here! Prices are great! People are so sweet this is a must come restaurant! The food is amazing Love the food here! Prices are great!

Well, the lot was packed Sunday at 3 pm so we decided to stop.   Ice cream was good.   Wings were ok.   I'm still here, no runs yet but I know where the bathroom is.","I was there 2 times. Food was great! But last week January 26, 2017 I decided to invite two friends to eat there. One day later we finished with food poison. We get so sick. Be careful!","No dan descuento a Seniors, Veteranos, a personas con la operation Bariatrica y no tienen precio de ninos. La comida no es tan Buena y no tienen sazon Boricua y segun el cajero/ ""Manager"" hoy que protesto porque lo creí  Boricua y resulto ser Dominicano. Por eso nos desacreditan! Como voy a creer que una gran mayoria de restaurantes Americanos, dan descuento de Senior, de Veteranos y por tener la operation Bariatrica y los restaurantes Latinos no quieren. Por eso no progresan.  El que diga Que esta Buena, no tienen familiares Que cocinen bueno o llevar mucho tempo fuera de la Isla. Aunque ya la comida en Puerto Rico, no esta tan Buena y es estilo Dominicano, además de cara. Tambien Los baños estan tan asquerosos como en Puerto Rico. Me imagine Que no Se La Van Las man Is. Los Dominicanos y los Cubanos, deberian estar en primera fila, para la deportacion.

El Melao tiene mejor precio y mejor sabor, apesar que tampoco consideran ningun descuento, ni militar, ni Senior, ni operacion bariatrica, ni nino, ni religioso, apesar de que son ""Religiosos"", pero lo que les importa es el dinero. A los militares les exijen tener Uniforme y les importa un pito el ID militar que es mas oficial, pues cualquiera se puede poner un uniforme.

El Palacio Buffet 2,7403 S Orange Blossom Trl,3.5,Wow. I am amazed of how good the food taste here. I went for all spañish food. Everything taste amazing.  It's cheap and servers are nice.,"My wife is New Yorican, and she loves the flavors of her native home (Puerto Rico), me, not to much. We stopped in on 3/5/2016 and I have to tell you we both was very happy. I can hardly wait until our next trip there. It was the best Latin food I have had in a restaurant. They also have a few Chinese dishes which I love also. Great job, you guys have it goin on.... Dan",EVRYTHING GREAT HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Price for dinner is 10 dollars drinks and everything included.,"I'm so sorry but how is this place even open for business? I'm really hoping that I went on an off day because the food was absolutely disgusting and everything tastes bitter and old. Usually I would give places another chance but this place has absolutely no chance for one. People seem to rave about how they offer both Spanish and Chinese food so that's why they give them good ratings but besides the food being appalling (couldn't finish anything), that is the exact reason I'm giving it 1 star. Too much stuff going on in terms of what to serve customers that the quality of the food fails horrible. Please if you are the owner and reading this. Focus in specializing in one type of food so that the quality becomes better. It's too all over the place. Until that happens, I will not be returning to this place anytime soon.",I have a few employees that used to eat there. Until my Admin said that she found a hair in her food and couldnt eat. SOOOOO lets just say i wont ever make it there. Im sure if people are saying they dont wear gloves they dont give a crap about a hair net.,Disgusting and dirty. I was so excited to try the Latin buffet... This place is 95% Chinese. Flys. Flys were everywhere. Sagging and stained ceiling panels. It's hot because the ac is not sufficient and the whole place is just dirty and sloppy.,157,1
El Palacio Buffet 3,843 Lee Rd,1.5,this was a nice surprise to walk into. place was very clean service was great and the food jesus they have food for everyone and any liking. music was also good. price was reasonable. i will definitely will bring my friends that like buffet style eating here. just so everyone know this place is a mix of Chinese food and Spanish food meanning Caribbean flare.,"If you like Hispanic foods this is the place to eat in Orlando. However, it could use some updating of the restaurant. The atmosphere is dark and outdated. With a little investment they could have a 5 rating.","We have NO idea why so many people bad mouth this buffet!  It's an AUCE buffet that is under $10! Seriously! And it included the drink!

We've been here 2x and we'll keep going back .. It's a wide variety of interesting foods, latin, asian, american, hibachi, seafood, salads, desserts!  It's like going to another country without the expense :)

The staff is super friendly (though most don't seem to speak much English) .. It's clean and the food is pretty well stocked .. Four of us went yesterday and we tried just about everything there ..

ONLY negative is that the signs above the food aren't always correct, some aren't in English, and some have no labels at all .. But we're daring and we tried most of it!!

Give them a shot!

* Also FYI .. Both times we went were during the week .. One around 4pm and other around 7pm ..","First time visiting this establishment an I am very disappointed! It was not clean, a lot of food had been sitting there for a while, many empty or almost empty pans, food was not labeled correctly, others were not labeled. There 2 waitresses and while there were several tables food of people they decided to sit at a booth and have Taco Bell and flirt with 2 gentlemen sitting on the booth next to them. They were not on their breaks but sat there for over 20 minutes not checking if anyone needed a drink or anything. Definitely my first and last! Gave a 1 start because I can't give any less!!!","This place used to be great when it was the Chinese buffet Wild Rice. We were so sad when it closed. 
Then it became El Palacio. They decided to fuse the restaurant and keep the Chinese food, the hibachi and the sushi plus have Spanish food. 
It was just ok at first. The Chinese food was still good. But the Spanish food was not. It became clear after a few visits that the management sucked. (We lived close so we went a lot)
One time we went there was MOLD on the cake. The manager really didn't seem to care. He DID NOT APOLOGIZE and made no attempt to make it better. 
The last time we went (and for the last time), the manager at the front took a phone call right in front of us and made us wait! Then he proceeded to talk over us in Spanish. So very unprofessional. The entire staff does that. I understand the food is Spanish but they SHOULD NOT speak Spanish around and over customers heads. It's rude and unprofessional. 
The food was cold and tasteless. The macaroni and cheese was absolutely swimming it was so watery. The chicken wings smelled and tasted bad. The crab had gone bad, it smelled rancid! I think my husband is lucky he didn't get sick from it. The only thing good was the rainbow sorbet.",This is the worst restaurant I've ever been to.  Staff is not friendly and the place was very dirty.  The food tasted cold and stale.  I actually had stomach issues for several days after eating there.  I will never go back again!,27,1
El Potro,"501 N Orlando Ave, Ste 217",4.0,My favorite lunch/dinner spot!! So quick and fresh!!!  The staff is amazing and the owner is very hands on. Monett is my favorite!  She is always so happy and accommodating. The steak tacos are a must!!,"Looks like s little hole in the wall. Looks can be deceiving. Authentic delicious food. Clean, great prices. Lunch special $5.99 for 2 Taco's w/rice & beans, with everything on lunch menu not costing too much more.  We don't do buffets, but in this case we couldn't help ourselves, & @ $8.99 it was great, I would have paid more.  And the service is friendly & welcoming.","I wish I had known about this place sooner! Every single thing I tried was delicious. The buffet price is fair ($12), two plates at the buffet will make it a good deal. Only bad part of the experience was how full I felt when I left because I just didn't want to stop eating. Please give El Potro your patronage. This place is exactly the type of small & local business that we need to support.",This place plain sucks the food is not good at all. Dont waist your time,"I don't know how El Potro manages to give you such awful stomach discomfort with every visit, but they manage with sparkling consistency.

I've given this location a few tries, as well as another one that closed up shop near my office (thankfully, as it made a few coworkers sickly). The entire chain is just rotten to the core.

The food itself doesn't taste bad even though it looks revolting. When I hated their dinner buffet, I went back for a menu item of enchiladas and rice. It was decent. Service was awful and our waiter disappeared for so long that my friend contemplated doing the dine-and-dash.

On my last and final visit, I didn't make it very far when that familiar, patented El Potro Gastrointestinal Misery hit me. I was in the parking lot, saying goodbye to my friend, when it hit me and I had to run into the neighboring KMart, which had bathrooms so disgusting that I am now permanently traumatized. Should you be thinking, ""Cristina C, maybe you're just sensitive to Mexican food,"" let me add that I often eat Taco Bell, which barely qualifies as food, without any side effects other than profound disappointment.

For forcing me to venture into a KMart bathroom, I cannot forgive El Potro.",Blah.. nothing special at all. Nothing here was good besides the service. I ordered  the 2 tacos and a barrito . Stick to the chicken!  The beef just wasn't my thing.  They do fill the tacos with enough meat. The guacamole didn't taste good it was way to wipped. Ugh.,252,1

Swing by if you're looking for amazing quick food.,"Delicious Latin flavors, rotisserie chicken, beans and rice, avocado salad, fried sweet plantains, roasted pork, fried chicken chicharrones, tostones and the list goes on and on.  Great lunch specials!","I useto go they're a lot, but since the Cuban Café express opened down the street, the quality of the they're food has fallen. And they're prices have gone up. I got rice with roast pork and escabeche, and two sodas, which normally would cost around $10.00. instead cost me $21.00. Once I got home I smelled the escabeche and found that it rotted. When I called them they just ignored what I told them and just hung up.","Really bad food. I wouldn't eat there again nor  recommend this place to anyone.  The escabeche is not fresh. Mine was ice cold and tasted like if it was sitting in a refrigerator uncovered for days. Just had a bad freezer taste. The green bananas in it we're so cold that it was clear it had been sitting in a refrigerator. Definitely not fresh and uneatable. The rice that was served with it had hard chunks from the bottom of the coooking pan.  Went there 2 times, fist time wasn't good either. I gave them the benefit of the doubt by going again but this time it's been confirmed. The food there is just no good.",I just got food from them thinking they may have changed. Only to find that they changed they're decor. But still have not changed they're flavor or look of they're food. The pernil was dry and for only getting two items which were white rice and pork. It was alot of rice and very little pork. Which was more like pulled pork floating in grease. They were low on arroz con gandules and they didn't even bother on going in back and seeing if they had any more?  I gave them a chance and they. Drop the ball.,8,1
Fresh Mediterranean Market,1500 Epcot Resorts Blvd,3.5,Casual table service. I got one of their customized salads with shrimp and all my desired vegetables and toppings. Seems a little hoky when ordering but the salad was AMAZING! Very friendly and prompt service. Nice atmosphere too and very clean. Worth going out of your way for some fresh tasty food!,"We often stay at the Dolphin because you can get a room similar to the nearby Yacht and Beach Club for 50% the price..  The Dolphin often has military discounts of 50% for its basic restaurants and Freeh Mediterranean Market is one of them.

The breakfast buffet is wonderful.  The chefs will use egg whites on the omelets and you pick the ingredients.  The baked goods are very good and the porridge melts in your mouth. I like the little power drinks.  Service is always quick and with a smile.  We eat a huge meal sometimes and have a late lunch at a fancy Epcot restaurant.

The only breakfast buffets that match this are at the Grand Floridian and Animal Kingdom Lodge and they are twice the price with a more exotic menu.","This place has an AMAZING breakfast buffet! You won't regret it at all. They have a chef that makes fresh omelettes, waffles, pancakes, and French toast! They also have pretty much every breakfast item imaginable! But beware, you will leave stuffed!","I had been eye balling their Afternoon Delight smoothie all week, final made in by before they close at 2pm. I got here at 1:45, hostesses were so busy cashing out their tills, I walked into diningroom to see about getting a smoothie to go. The cooks were helpful and said I had to order at the hostess desk. A manager type came up and asked if she could help me, yes I would like to order a smoothie. She took me to hostess desk and took order. Hostess finally stopped cashing out till to take my payment without even making eye contact. She then begrudgingly said she would bring it out to me. When she came back, she says here, plops it on the table and goes back to till. Unfortunately the smoothie was so runny, my cardboard straw that was too short for the cup fell in and started to disintegrate, becasue cardboard in liquid.. worst $10 ""smoothie"" I have ever had.","Apparently it's impossible to communicate your order correctly to the staff. I wanted to order two hard-boiled eggs for breakfast for my kids who would only eat that. So I ordered some food and asked for two hard-boiled eggs. Waitress asked if I wanted them very hard. I said yes. She brought me an omelette. I said that that was not what I wanted. She insisted that I ordered exactly that. I said that I would keep the omelette and asked if she could bring me two hard-boiled eggs. She asked again if I wanted very hard eggs. Not poached. I said that I did not want poached eggs, my kids would only eat hard-boiled eggs. I waited and she brought me two poached eggs. Which my kids wouldn't eat. I sent them back. I was too much in a hurry to Disney park to ask for a manager, so I paid my $30 bill which included tip, and I left with my kids still hungry. Ridiculous.",Tucker was awful. It took us an hour and a half for breakfast. The omelet was wrong and it took about 20 minutes to fix it. There were tables turning over before we even were served. Other servers seemed to be great.,54,1
Garden Grill Restaurant,1510 N Cove Rd,4.0,"This was a fun restaurant to visit!

First, the food. Three course's, breakfast foods, continental. There was a cinnamon bun served in a pan. Then there were bacon, eggs, tater-tots, Mickey waffles with chocolate hazelnut ganache, and slices of ham. All you can eat breakfast items; with coffee, tea, and juice. They offer tropical juices as well.

The restaurant rotates, and takes one hour to make a revolution. You overlook part of 'Living with the Land' ride which is below the restaurant, and as the restaurant turns you see the land and the farm. Pretty cool to watch as the boats go by for the attraction. 

To boot, Disney characters come by and gives the guests photo opportunities. The cast members were actually pretty funny, using physical comedy to entertain guests. The servers were very pleasant and warm. If you're reading Disney, Joanne was fabulous and made for a memorable visit.","Amazing experience with the whole restaurant turning and the scenery, plus Chip & dale coming to the table with goofy . The food and service was excellent and I can't wAit to go back!!!","Come here hungry! The food is amazing, the characters are adorable, and they have sweet tea!","If you are a couple this place is awful. Also, if you have a dairy allergy, you're out of luck. Everything has dairy and the food is awful without all the dairy sauces.  I couldn't even get rare beef. 

This place is ONLY good for the characters that come around to visit kids and the ""family"" style eating.","Came here with visiting relatives who wanted to eat at someplace different at EPCOT. Overpriced tor family-style You pay for the experience of dining with the characters. Very mediocre food and unfortunately service is lacking. I guess since it is a family-style the servers do not feel obligation to pay attention to the guests. We had to continually ask for refills on food and drinks as the waiter barely came by. So disappointing I felt I really wasted a meal here. Food is served all together on one long plate and gravies,
 other foods mix with each other so it was poor presentation and a sloppy mess. I do not eat beef and had to seek out a section where the juices did not touch all the other food.  No choice on dessert - you had to take what was made that day. 
Bad concept, bad meal, bad experience.","Do not ever eat here. That's really all I should havr to say.

The food is disgusting. Inedible. Do you want a luke-warm cast-iron skillet full of over-cooked vegetables and about four days' worth of carbs? Ok, then go here. Otherwise, avoid at all costs.

Do you want to pay through the nose for food that your nose is begging you not to eat. OK, then go here.

In all seriousness, Disney has some pretty crappy food. But, this place takes the cake. (And, it's a dry, stale, over-sweetened cake.) The service makes clear that you're there for the characters and that it's not supposed to be a meal. The gruel is brought out in steady fashion, and you sit there like human veal being stuffed with garbage. One example of this garbage is the picture I've included of the ""mac-n-cheese."" It was really s dip of disgusting cheap melted cheese, with a few noodles floating in it and.... wait for it.... goldfish on top. Yes, those goldfish. Oh, but there's more. It came with a side of....french fries.

I would never go back to this place. In fact it was so bad, it soured me on the entire Disney thing. They should be embarrassed to serve the food they have there and charge the price they do. For a place that prides itself on hospitality, this place seems to be the dark under-belly.

One last thing - we called the morning of the day of our reservation, because we had a question about a dietary restriction. We could only leave a message for the manager. We explained in the message we had a reservation that night and had a question about dietary issues. We did receive a call back. The thing is, that call came more than 72 hours later.",253,1
Gateway To India,790 E State Rd 434,4.0,"My husband and I ate here during the lunch buffet and everything was SO yummy. They also made rice pudding, which was amazing. Id pay extra to take some home. We would deffinately recomend this place, and will eat here again","I LOVE LOVE the food, THE CHILI BREAD & the service. 
I love this restaurant so so much 
I wish I could eat there everyday","Wish I could eat here everyday.. sometimes I do. Great people, phenomenal food, good prices. Their chicken tikka masala is the best I've had anywhere.","Used to get the Chicken Korma. Been 2 years. Just moved back to the area. Ordered my usual. WORST!! Korma I've ever had. Couldn't taste any coconut at all. The rice used to be great... Tender Jasmine with orange zest and other  stuff.  Not now.  Plain white,  no flavor.  Naan bread used to be great. Not now.  Tough and greasy.  $26 bucks down the toilet.  Never be back.","Guys don't even think of going to this place , we came at 7:30 pm and at 8:00 pm, we got a samosa and water with some papad. There is only one cook , so they were not able to handle 4 groups of people. 

Super slow service and if you have spare time like 4 - 5 hours , then only go. 

Lastly , they the cook is rude to us.

I am never ever ever ever ... ever ever going to this place.

Bad bad !","My wife and I went to eat lunch at this place and were seated by the host. Host said that your server will be right with you to take order. We sat there exactly 18 minutes, server never came to take our order. Looked like it was owner or manager working as server. Finally we got up and left. Really bad guest service.",189,1
Giant Panda,11726 E Colonial Dr,3.0,"Pretty picky about buffets, but went during lunch and it was really good. Food was super fresh, and had a variety of items. Sushi was amazing. Hibachi was great as well. Definitely recommend if you like buffets, but would recommend going around noon as they just placed the food out and everything seemed to be fresh.","You name it they have it :D I had one of the best Hibachi foods over here. There are many items to pick. As a lover chicken lover i get to eat so many varieties (Hibachi, Pepper Chicken, Orange Chicken, Fried Chicken .. so ooooon). The quality of the food is decent over here. 

They have noddles, fried rice, white rice with chicken, fish, salmon varieties on the side. They are many veggies to add to it. The one that i liked most over here is Black Pepper Chicken and Orange chicken. 

Desserts are amazing over here. I don't remember exactly the names but there are couple of pastries which are top-notch. I like the Banana with some syrup thingy very much :D They have pretty good amount of fruits and Ice cream too. 

Overall its a steal deal for your bucks ($7.99 on weekdays for lunch). Please try it if you haven't before. I know it is located in a plaza where nothing much is happening. I give 5 out of 5 stars for their number of varieties and equally maintaining the quality and taste for almost all the items. 

Note : Skip your breakfast if you are going for lunch. If possible skip previous day's dinner too... lolll !!! Coz you see food everywhere","Let's be real here, considering all the food and the quality of the food you get for their lunch price this place is amazing! I have only ever been here for their lunch, but I've been here on multiple occasions. My review is solely based on their lunch.

The service is always great and the servers are always super sweet! 

For $7.99 you get to eat a variety of food at lunch. 

They have a exceptional variety of sushi and sometimes have sashimi. They also have edamame which I love to have before sushi. Don't forget to grab chopsticks when at the sushi station! 

The variety of hot foods they have is great, everything from fried rice and rice noodles to steamed custard buns, chicken nuggets (great for kids), soups, vegetables (green beans, mushrooms, and even potatoes), and a large selection of chicken (general tso's, black pepper, hibachi, sesame honey, and sweet and sour --to mention some). 

On top of all that I already mentioned there is a salad bar with fruits, jello, kimchi, and pasta salad.

Then there's the hibachi station, you can pick from a variety of vegetables (zucchini, sprouts, mushrooms, etc.) and meats (beef, chicken, shrimp). You put what you want and as much as you want on your plate and hand it to the chef at the hibachi station. 

He cooks everything in front of you and then hands you the plate of delicious food! I recommend trying the white sauce located directly to the right of the hibachi station with the hibachi, it tastes great! 

Now onto deserts, they have a selection of small cakes (coffee, mango, chocolate) and even a coffee mousse that I would recommend to any coffee lover. They also have elephant ears and almond cookies.

Also in he back near the hibachi to the left there is ice cream. They have a good selection of flavors to choose from. My all time favorite is the green tea ice cream, I would come here just for this. 

Overall, this is a great place to come for lunch! The price is unbeatable, the food/food selection is amazing, and the service is great. I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone. I've brought many of my friends here and gotten them hooked. This is my all time favorite Chinese buffet!","RUDE waitress slammed the check on our table and kept walking... overall the food was okay but after that rude ""customer service"", will not be going back. Train your employees to treat customers well even if they are having a bad day...","So we usually come here for lunch because it's pretty good and near work, been here about 10 times now so they know we're regulars,  well today while eating my salad a piece of metal that comes from a steel sponge was in it,  I actually almost swallowed it.  I completely lost my appetite and told my server about it.  This is the best they could do... .80 cents  off of my bill.. well I'm not coming back there anymore.. I should have taken a picture of the piece of metal but unfortunately I couldn't think at the time...  anyways everyone be careful","Worst customer service ever!!  Waitress was very unfriendly and rude.  The owner or the main person in the restaurant was extremely rude and had no customer service skills whatsoever.  She needs to attend an intensive training on how to treat customers.  She gave us a hard time when we tried to use the 10% coupon that is posted in their website and argued with everything that we tried to explain to her. Her logic, excuses and lies made no sense at all, she had no clue of what she was talking about.  It is RIDICULOUS having to spend 20 minutes to pay for my bill.  I will not be coming back to this place.  Food is not the greatest, horrible customer service and dirty dishes!  I grabbed a plate that had rice stuck to it!  DISGUSTING!!  If you are looking for a place with good customer service, AVOID GIANT PANDA!!",165,1
Golden Corral Buffet & Grill 1,11731 E. Colonial Drive,3.0,"Came here for lunch with my husband! Only place I could think of that serves decent American comfort food around ucf. The food here isn't the best quality but there's a little be of everything to try out. 

The atmosphere here is much friendlier than any other golden corral I have ever been too. My server, Jasmine, went out of her way to help me exchange soda flavors. Even the costumers were nice! Normally I tend to avoid other customers while collecting my food but here we even threw a few jokes back and forth with them. 

The store is clean and shiny so I would recommend it for those unsure of what they'd like to eat.",This location is amazing. Everything is so clean the food is delicious the management is amazing! All around an amazing experience thank you guys so much for everything. God bless you all,"We came today for breakfast and Elizabeth took great care of us. Actually she spoiled us being so attentive. The service was better than the food quality where the donut was hard and actually crunchy in the center, telling me it's a frozen product before baked. The pancakes had a powdery taste and consistency. The French toast was very good and the bacon and corn beef hash also. Elizabeth service is what made up for the experience today at this Golden Corral.
We usually sit by Valerie's section when we come for Dinner, because of the awesome service Valerie gives us. So we are glad we was at Elizabeth section today.","Save yourself the trouble, the quality of the food at this location is not good. 

I ate at noon sharp on a Tuesday. The following food items were either tough or cold or inedible: fish, Chinese style pork, Chinese-style chicken and eggrolls. My friend tasted her food and stopped eating. She tried a second helping of different food items and came up with the same results. She tried the green beans, pinto beans, Chinese rice, collard greens, and baked beans. The only things I tried that were delicious were the BBQ pulled pork and the fresh watermelon.

The location in West Colonial is much better.","Kids love this place, not for the meals but for deserts. The food to me is subpar, I would recommend that if you go there don't try too many different foods. You leave feeling pretty sick. Not that you ate a lot but  the foods don't mix well. The place is pretty new and attracts an odd crowd of customers. Crying kids and very loud college students. They cram so many people in there you can't help but fell closed in. The waitress is constantly coming to the table, to clear it. But to me it's more like trying to get the table cleared as fast as they can for the next crowd.

Not a fan of any of the chicken entrees every thing they had reminded me of bad hospital food. The pizza looked like dough with sauce, didn't see much cheese on it. Deserts to me had no taste, just bland. People appeared to like it but what do I know. They seem to go for the unlimited buffet they offer, without regards to taste.

It's a very hectic place to eat. Workers are constantly moving carts all over the place. Making it very difficult to get around not their fault but not at all professional. Just disorganized.

One thing they seem to do right is make rolls, they were good. But I gotta say I almost threw up twice, once because I choked on some fat. The second time because I was overwhelmed by the different mixtures of salty food. I had to leave after that as I didn't want to get sick in there.

I changed my star rating from a three, two then one. I didn't want to give such a low rating. But everything was so bad I had no choice. It's not the location it's a beautiful location, I've been tricked 3 times over the years to give this franchise a chance only to get sick to my stomach.

We used to go to Barnhills on 17-92 that place ran much better, they didn't have the crowd corral does but the workers weren't constantly pushing carts. The food was also much better.

This location is brand new, so everything is bright and shiny not sure how long they can keep that appearance with so much turnover.

Not really interested in returning as I am trying to diet, and as bad as the food is here, it must have insane calories and fat. I remember well why I always leave golden corral and say to myself never again. Well that lasted over ten years till now.

There are coupons on the website,but you can't use them there.","Went by on Sunday for lunch. The ""dinner"" prices are inflated but rather than the hassle of cooking and cleanup, I paid for two adults and three kids. I fully understand that this is not fine dining but it's not much to ask to keep food stocked and hot. 

The children of the employees were being babysat by other members of the wait staff. The staff was eating more than serving and when my son asked for a cheeseburger from the grill, he was told that was for ""employees only"".  

There is little to no management running the facility as there were multiple children (less than 6 years old) pulling food and bowls directly from the bar and then putting it back when they didn't like it. 

I don't expect caviar and prime rib from GC but I would appreciate being put ahead of the employees and their families. Especially when I pay $12 for lunch per person. Although I used to frequent this with my family, I won't go back.",74,1
Golden Corral Buffet & Grill 10,2328 S. Semoran Blvd.,2.5,I usually visit the Colonial and Alafaya location but today we came here and we enjoyed the different atmosphere. Jazz playing and the set up is easy to move around in. Elizabeth took very good care of us and was very attentive with a great personality. Ask for her section next time you visit. I know we will.,Genuine kindness & true customer service. Sebastian was thoughtful and made a cake creation for my daughters birthday. :),"They remodel not long time ago. Very clean, my server was very attentive and food was delicious. I used to have issues there before, not anymore!","Our server was Trish, she was an elderly lady. At first she seemed nice but as me and my girlfriend sat down it became clear that she wasn't as nice as we thought. I'm an African American male and my girlfriend is Caucasian, which is why I think all this happened. We sat down all cheerful and went to get our food as usually. When we came back we were never greeted by her and she never introduced herself. It was only us, an older gentleman, and another couple in her section.  Everyone else got greeted and service but me and my girlfriend. A couple even came in after us and Trish greeted and served them with no problem.  We never got our plates taken away so I just neatly piled them in the corner, and we also went without getting refills of our drinks the entire time we were there. I eventually just gave my drink to my girlfriend because I wasn't that thirst anyways.  It was just really amazing how we were completely ignored by this lady. Multiple times I made eye contact with her and even signaled for her but she never came to our table. She would just walk past us and continue to help other tables. All in all it was really a horrible serving experience the food was good but the way we were treated was really just uncalled for. I know some people are thinking why not call a manager, and to you I say why should I have to go to such extremes just to get service. I didn't do anything rude, I was very polite and respectful. At least she could've said hello and introduced herself and I would be fine with that. Like I said it was just a bad experience and I had to calm my girlfriend down from making a huge scene.  Just remember if you're a server try to treat everyone with the same respect you would want from someone else.",Witness a cook eating on the line. DISGUSTING Called health department There is no number for corporate customer service. When I approached the manager he was not surprised. He said he would look into it.

Come for the food, sit in Lisa's section for THE best service, and leave full!","Our food was hot, drinks were full, and the table was cleaned often.

Buffet doesn't have to mean disgusting dry dog food on a pretty platter being served to you and you eat  it because of the name or who is serving it to you.","Had rave reviews from neighbors who tried it.  I think NOT.  As buffets go, this one was not good.  Food over cooked, over salted, flat in flavor. Plus you never know who's hands were just in the food you are getting ready to serve yourself.

The food was excellent, the service friendly, and the price was right ($58.30 for four people, two seniors and two adults). The selection was classic American/American Southern style food. Everything I had was flavorful and cooked to perfection, all the fruits and vegetables used were of peak ripeness.

The chocolate fountain was a really fun finish to an excellent meal, something I'd imagine a lot of kids liking. The banana pudding...it was perfect. I wanted to take a bucket of it home with me.

The bathroom was a wreck, complete with human fecal matter smeared all over the bathroom door. Not a joke or exaggeration. I used the restroom before we left, but had I seen that in the beginning, I surely wouldn't have eaten there.

Golden Corral Buffet & Grill 4,8707 Vineland Avenue,2.5,"Thank you so much to the Manager, the staff and our waiter Danny who helped us today! We went to lunch today only to have a rude, insensitive lady go off in front of us screaming and swearing saying they shouldn't allow pets! She was cussing a storm and wanted her money back as her family was still going to eat there but she insisted she shouldn't have to sit with dogs! The manager politely came over to talk with her and said yes they allow service animals. He was so dignified and professional. The lady started saying she wanted the know the disability and the manager explained to her how she doesn't have to be told. Meanwhile, we are with 3 autism/asb children and one is turning into my husband for comfort. He is the one carrying Reese his service dog which clearly stays Asberg/autism service dog! People just because you can't see a physical handicap doesn't mean there isn't one. Yes for the record my Stella is certified as well. Her leash shows it, I chose not to share it all the time. But yes she is my service dog. I felt horrible for me and the boys! The dogs did their job, not one bark or sound was made. Both dogs stayed on the floor and did exactly that they were supposed to do. I appreciate the manager coming back over to check on us. We sat far away from anyone else. Again thank you Golden Corral for your professionalism and compassion.

The food was good. It's your usual buffet. The service was great!","Let's just start by saying I Love golden coral lol but this place was great everyone was nice, but what makes a great restaurant is your servers and staff.  let me tell you our server Dan was GREAT he was attentive, nice and courteous you just don't get service like that especially at a buffet always make sure to tip especially when service is good",Best steak ever. Food is ALWAYS piping hot. A great place to eat in Orlando.,"We're from San Diego and were always teased by the commercials, as there aren't any locations near our home so we decided to try Golden Corral while visiting Orlando. I was disappointed with the food. It was boring and bland. I wouldn't eat here again.","Oh Golden Corral, you teased me with delicious looking commercials, only to have zero locations in Southern California. Well, I found you at last  and it was disappointing to say the least.

Something told me to turn around and leave as soon as I walked in. Maybe it was the hoards of children running amok or the crumbs crushed into the carpet or perhaps even the stacks of tacky colored plastic plates that even the worst Vegas buffets would snub their noses at. But alas, I persisted. 

One look at the buffet and I said to my mom, ""whoa this is junk food heaven."" So much food in varying shades of golden brown and beige - stuffing, mashed potatoes, hush puppies, shrimp, chicken, fish, okra, fries, mushrooms (all fried, natch). Actually the fried mushrooms were kind of good, in a heavily battered sort of way. The roast chicken was also surprisingly juicy and I liked the rice pilaf. Anything with pasta was boiled to oblivion and the other meats were dry. If you're a first timer like me and don't know how to get a steak, you need to go up the grill and stick your plate out, at which point the grill man will put meat on your plate. 

There are also stations for cooked to order seafood (including krab cakes - note the K) as well as your usual salad, soup and taco/nacho bar. The bread case was also somewhat tempting and I missed the giant yeast roll, but I did try the garlic cheese biscuit thing which sort of reminded me of Red Lobster. And of course the highlight of the dessert bar is the chocolate fountain. Strawberries were quite good, but I found the rice krispies and macaroon to be tooth achingly sweet. 

Lesson learned - avoid buffets unless you're in Vegas. There was some good people watching though, like the 300+ lb woman at the table next to us who brought 2 heaping plates at a time - I'm pretty sure she would be a shoe in for the next season of Biggest Loser.","I ordered a medium well steak and received a blood red burnt  piece of mystery meat.

Golden Corral Buffet & Grill 5,6077 W. Irlo Bronson Memorial,2.0,"Went on Veterans Day. Was crowded due to free meals for vets. But we still got seated quickly. Food was kept up. Hot. Tasted Awesome! Ate a lot. More than usual. Chicken, fish, roast beef, steak, pasta, potatoes, lots of veggies. Fruit. Had an awesome server as well. Vicki did an amazing job.  Place is clean. Workers hard at work. Manager greeted everyone and coordinated seating. It was very busy for a while and they handled the rush well.","Yeah that's right I'm giving this Golden Corral 5 stars -- no shame.

Came to this Golden Corral after a long day at Epcot. Tired and massively hungry, we were ready to DIG IN. This was my first time ever going to a Golden Corral, I had no idea what to expect, but I was NOT disappoint.

Wow - so many options! Everything looked so good, I didn't know where to start. Steak was suggested, so I started there.

Through a window, you can ask for your steak to be cooked to your liking, and you can stand around and watch it cook. I asked for Medium well and received a perfectly Medium well steak. I got a bunch of sides including zucchini, broccoli with cheese, carrots, mashed potato, fresh tortilla chips with spinach dip, etc.

Wow, all the food was SO good! The steak was absolutely delicious, tender, so good. The sides were also delicious. The chips were super fresh. I was so full by this point but I served myself some more goodies and are some more delicious food.

I was so full by dessert time but I still managed to have some. Marshmellows and strawberries covered in chocolate via a glorious chocolate fountain, cookies, brownies, banana cream pie, cake, a little bit of everything. The desserts were awesome.

Service was excellent and the place seemed clean. I have zero disappointments and was nothing but totally pleased with my experience at Golden Corral. Nothing less than 5 stars!","I love it here , I didn't even want to leave lol . Sooooooo many food options as well as dessert options . I ate until I couldn't eat anymore ! It was just so yummy . All of the workers are so pleasant and friendly . I can't wait to go back again !","This is the worst Golden Corral I have ever been too. It's not busy but no one is bothering in keeping the dishes full.  Good luck trying to get anything from the grill because no one is cooking on it.  There is food crumbs all over the place on the serving counters,  I have yet to see anyone cleaning up.  Half the dishes in the salad bar are empty and the other half are mixed with the items next to them them.  It's obvious the manager is terrible and that these employees have no pride in there work.  I will never come here again!","Definitely the WORST food I have ever eaten in my life! The only thing I found somewhat edible was a plate of white rice. Everything else I barely ate, or ended up spitting into my napkin. Everything had a weird taste to it. The staff is super rude, and the place is really dirty. The plates/silverware still had food stuck on them, and there is an overall gross stench to the place. I've eaten lots of strange things in my life, esp as a world traveler but this tops it as the worst. Run!","Over priced, food stands designed to prevent customers from getting the foods.

Golden Corral Buffet & Grill 6,11701 International Dr,3.5,"This place is really clean. The staff are pleasant and friendly. Our waiter while not chatty, was attentive and frequently made sure we were ok. A fabulous variety of really fresh, delicious food. From salads with house made dressings to grilled steak done to your liking. The desert bar is varied and delicious. The chocolate fountain was well maintained and had a great choice of things to smother from fruit to marshmallows. There is a constant bustle in the kitchen and food is changed with frequency. 
The bathrooms, while a little small, were clean and smelled that way. 
The staff obviously takes pride in their location and it shows. Would come back and would defiantly recommend. The price was about $70 for 3 adults with drinks and 2 children. We all left very satisfied with the kids asking ""when are we coming back?"".","The best Golden Corral in Orlando. manager is on top of it checking his employees, the food and patrons  this is not even in the same category as the other ones. Corporate needs to take notes from this one

Third visit as it is a easy meal with children
The place still tops in this category and even surpassed its last recommendation. The steak and shrimp was excellent. And again, the assistant manager was all over the place where needed.  As cashier, ensuring guests were happy, clearing tables and keeping the hard working staff upbeat","We were taken here by some relatives since we are in town and don't get to see them too often. When I heard they were taking us to Golden Corral, I didn't know what to really expect. I've never been to one although I have seen commercials and it just looks average. Needless to say I was very very wrong. Unsure if it's just this location based upon other reviews, but this place was all around great. Our waiter was so nice and extremely accommodating. He made sure we were all set and always came back to ask if we needed anything else. Now onto the food, it's everything you could ask for and more. Any craving? It's probably there. The pulled pork, steak, fried chicken and yeast rolls were stand outs to me. I also loved that they had a salad bar as it gives you another alternative if you're not feeling too gluttonous. I noticed a majority of the food was fresh and if it was standing there for a while they replaced it. The dessert bar was ridiculous! So much ice cream, cakes and even a chocolate fountain. My cousin is an ice cream fanatic and even asked me if this is heaven..","I went to this location yesterday and was beyond disappointed and quite frankly deserved to get my money back. 

When we walked in every available table was dirty with the prior occupants feed and dishes. When we asked one of the waiters to clean a table off for us . He just stood there and stared at us. Very rude! It took us asking 2 waiters before getting help.

When I went to get a plate it was dirty! Had mashed potatoes all over it and a few plates under it. I thought they washed these things. The floor had food all over it. I just couldn't bring myself to eat much of anything there.

I tried some fried fish and veggies. That wasn't even good. I will never go to any Golden Corral... Ever!","overly disgusted with this place which is down the block from universal studios.  it was dirty, understaffed and it smelled really bad.",Went in for carry out and they told me one price at the register and when i came back to pay they raised the price on me.,116,1

My wife was horrified and to boot, a member of our party unknowingly stepped in it!!  Can't make this stuff up!!  I can go on and on about how dirty and how disgusting the food was but I just don't have all day. Just do yourself a favor and avoid this place like the plague!!  I would give this place negative stars if it allowed me. Lol","I gave this restaurant one star because this app will not let me leave ZERO STARS. I'm not a fan of buffets to begin with but we had a large group of people with different dietary needs so this seemed to be the best solution. I can't remember when I've been to a nastier place to dine. Half of the ""stations"" were empty so there wasn't much selection. I will say that the lettuce was fresh so we had a lot of salad. No one ever came by to ask to refill our drinks. The worst, however, was as I headed to the restrooms I could smell ""waste"" very strongly. Turns out that someone had an accident right on the rug in the middle of the hallway in front of the bathroom doors!  But wait... That's not the worst of it. It was left there for so long that someone actually stepped in it by accident. It took this restaurant at least 15 minutes to address this issue and clean it up. I have never EVER encountered something so disgusting in a dining establishment. They have a huge plaque by the front door calling themselves a ""model restaurant""... Ha!!!",123,1

I will probably not return for a long time only because I have to steer clear of buffets haha","We have gone to this Golden Corral over several years on occasion but recently we went back and what a change, in the past found it was too expensive for the quality but just visited again and was impressed by everything.  Already looking forward to eating there again. They have certainly improved and if it didn't have the name Golden Corral outside I would think the food was from a different restaurant. Maybe they have new management but everything was clean even the bathrooms. Also all the food was fresh and delicious. The service was very good regarding keeping the drinks filled and removing dirty plates. But the food was wonderful. We were at another Golden Corral recently and I had to spit out the sweet potatoes they were so bad among other things but at the Altamonte Golden Corral had to go back for seconds, they were so good. Interesting how the taste was so different, didn't make a lot of sense. The only small issue I had was the spoons in the salad dressing were a bit hard to read as to which salad dressing was which and the Blue Cheese was marked with another dressing but when I figured it out it was delicious like everything else. Now they need to get the other Golden Corrals to offer the same level of taste, service and cleanliness as this one in Altamonte, FL.","Used to be a great place to eat.

So they came out 19 minutes after I originally asked (I watched them finally bring them out so I went up). What another disappointment. Watery macaroni cheese soup. Sounds pretty great right?

So I'm scoping out the sushi which by the way wasn't all that good or fresh  but this little kid decide that he want to pick up a sushi from off the plate from the buffet, bites it and puts it back up there after saying he didn't like it.  So at that point I was heated and ready to go because that's was one of the nastiest thing i have witness in person take place in a restaurant.  He looked at me as he knew what he had done was wrong and the whole time I was giving him the ""you need your tail beat look"" for that! So if you go there best watch out for ""snackers"" at the buffet, that them ppl that eat while fixing there plates because sometime they grab from the buffet with there hands.. Also, the pictures that they have posted are deceiving, it looks nothing like that!!!",This is a worst place I have never been. All servers are talking while I ask for some helps. The host does not care about their customers even tho we are just standing in front of her. I would like to give 0 star if I can!,"Not good. Had high hopes considering the variety of food served, pics of nigiri, sashimi, and other fresh looking fare I saw on Yelp. Don't know what happened. Staff was nice and the restaurant looked good but the food just sucked. Nothing I tried was even remotely good. The ""sushi"" consisted of an assortment of rolls stuffed mostly with cream cheese and cucumber. Only fish in any of them was tasteless tuna. Even the soy sauce tasted cheap. All the hot stuff was awful from the pan fried dumplings that were in a steam pot so they were mush, to the classics like honey chicken and beef and broccoli. All chewy and old tasting. I thought maybe the hibachi would yield some fresh flavors. Wrong. I asked for the hibachi sauce but got a plate that, although it looked good, smelled like an old sock and had no flavor other than the off taste of butter or oil or whatever it is they squeeze on the grill before cooking your plate. I've been to dozens of these type places and can't say any have dissapointed to this level. Too bad.",401,1
Hokkaido Chinese & Japanese Buffet 2,12173 S Apopka Vineland Rd,3.0,"Found this new place by accidentally passing by! Me and my sister came by after shopping at the outlet that was literary less than 10 minutes drive away. We were welcome in by the manager and the host, inside is completely not what we were expecting, it was beautiful and take your breath away by amount of food! We had the Brunch, which is $10.99, it is worth every penny of it. I've been to many restaurant in Orlando, this is by far the best deal!
Hibachi was great, the selection of vegetable, seafood(shrimp, squid, fish), and meat are all good. But the the cut of steak they have is fantastic, very juicy & tasty! And instead of stir-fry the steak, they even grill it for you, so it lock all the flavor!! ( I had like 3 steaks :) ).
Sushi for brunch have decent amount of selection, mostly rolls, no nigiri, but are on point.
The cold bar have some fresh steam shrimp, crayfish and mussel, talking about getting your money worth it.
The hot bar is really on point, they have 3 row of hot bar, and have all the traditional buffet items like rice, noddle, chicken wing, all kind of soup, fried meat, steam fish, but also have many other items that catch my eye (large steam clam, mussel with black bean sauce, and more...).
And last but not least, they have tiny cake selection along with fruits and jelly. But I was too full already after two scope of cookie and cream ice cream.....oh yeah, they also have nice ice cream!! = tummy happy  

Overall, the food was great, the service was friendly, atmosphere is nice and quite, and decoration is pretty cool (they have this amazing drawing on the wall at left when you first enter). I really love the food and the experience. I head the dinner selection are even better, looking forward to go back and try it! I highly recommend everyone to go and walk out like me with happiness.",a huge selection of sushi and a great buffet. unbelievable price for the selection and quality. I was very satisfied and will be back.,"Just ate here with 3 friends. We were all quite happy. I don't know what folks expect when they go to an Asian food buffet, but this experience was nothing but positive. The food was the quality I would expect from a buffet of this nature; it wasn't dry or under cooked, and it tasted good! Their variety is impressive. The facility is clean. The wait staff is polite. The price is very reasonable. Those who have left a negative review here either have unreasonably high standards for a buffet restaurant, or they hit the place on a bad day. In any case, I highly recommend this restaurant if you know what to expect from an Asian food buffet, and if you don't, come here for a great first time experience.","Came in, a lady seated us but as I wanted to tell her that if we can sit at a booth, she left. So my little sister and I had to go and sit ourselves. We waited 6min. For the waiter to ask us what to drink. Still nothing, we just said whatever, let's go get food. First we looked around and then made a decision. Sat down and still no drinks or server. The party of 10 sat across from us and a waiter asked for drinks then came to us and finally asked. Pretty much 15min. Later. The mussels were good. My little sister loved the fries, but the dumplings had a weird texture. The food was okay. Nothing to brag about. I loved the oysters but because you can never go wrong with it. But do you wanna know the 2 worst things? The sweet tea was just water mixed with sugar. And the #1 disgusting food we'd ever tried was the strawberry mousse. It tasted like pepto Bismol. Hands down for real it tasted like it. My little sister and I almost threw up. Our faces were in need of help. We asked for the check. I had a 15% coupon but I don't think the amount was correct. But again, whatever to get us out of there. Left and decided to go to that pizza place next door.",Worst buffet.  Food was COLD. I would never go again.   The fruit was warm.  Nothing hat should have been hot was hot.  I was scared it would make me sick.,"The price was right, but as they say ""you get what you pay for""; the food was awful, some dishes looked down right scary and I've eaten at many Asian buffets. The tables and chairs were smeary wet where the waitress hurriedly sat us down under water dripping from a vent onto my shoulders. Oh, had to ask waitress several times to bring our drinks...service questionable",331,1
Hollywood & Vine,351 S Studio Dr,3.0,"This restaurant located in Hollywood Studios is casual with a large buffet. I found it to be very enjoyable due to the characters that were there and the staff. 

When I went up to the buffet I asked them what foods are gluten free and the chef took the time to walk down the entire buffet and point out what I could eat. I truly appreciated that because when I have even the smallest amount of wheat I can have digestive issues for weeks. Some restaurants just do not understand this issue.

I found the salad to be fresh and the potatoes well cooked. The roast beef was by far the best roast beef I have ever had. 

The dessert table had a ton of tiny delicious looking treats. I could only try a few that didn't have wheat in them, however I was able to make a small
Root beer float! 

Our waitress was very attentive. When she saw the characters coming around the room she encouraged us to wait to get our food until we got to meet them. I really appreciated that because this was the first character meal that I have ever taken my child to, and honestly I doubt we will go to another one due to cost. However - it was a really nice time. All the characters interacted with us and even hugged me! I was able to get multiple photos that we will cherish. 

I found the cost of this character buffet to be far less expensive than the ones at Magic Kingdom (about $30 less), so I was very glad to have found this location.

Thumbs up to this restaurant. It may not be upscale  but for us - it served its purpose of helping us to create memorable moments.",My favorite Disney breakfast buffet and character meet and greet! Their cheesy grits hit the spot on a cold November morning! They even have an omelette station for the adults made to order! Best tip - be the first family in at 8 am for a special surprise!!!,"Being a cast member of WDW, I personally have always wanted to eat at Hollywood & Vine bc I love the characters there that they have for dinner; Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, and Goofy.

The food and dessert they offered I thought was amazing! I believe the offerings change ever so often but being an adventurous eater, it definitely satisfied my palette. My friend who is a pickier eater even thought it was delicious as well. 

The character interactions were awesome, but it also depends on your energy, they feed off of that. With the price being $50 per adult, it was definitely a little expensive but still so much fun!","Being season pass holders we have eaten many times at H&V.  Feels as if the service (no one smiles and feels like they care how your experience is) and the food have gone downhill -- def feels like a very expensive middle school lunch cafe line.  

You do get the characters so if that's your reason for your going - it's fine.","Extremely expensive, $50 per person for lunch, and the food was cold, the fish was not fresh, the macaroni and cheese was sticky, the salad was watery, and even the wine was bad. Never again!","We made reservations for 7, several minutes maths in advance. Show up 45 minutes early. Told we can't check in until 15 minutes before. So we wait. 

Check in and are promptly seated at a table for 6. Ask to be reseated. One hostess says we have to put a chair at the end. Another says we can move the table next to us over. Busboy tells us we can't move it over.  15 minutes in and still trying to get this resolved as our waitress tells us we can't as well. 

We've been coming here to this specific restaurant for about 8 years.  This visit it seems like customer service has gone way down.",287,1
Ichiban Buffet 1,5529 International Dr,3.0,"I wish I found this sooner than another buffet I tried out. It's so dirt cheap with AMAZING selection that you literally feel like you're being trolled. Lunch special is 8.99 and dinner is 11.99. The sushi was pretty good but rice was a bit weird because they all stuck together. Spicy tuna was delicious so no complaints here! 

A semi decent salad bar, good hot foods, good fried foods, and ice cream section. Overall, if I were to visit Orlando again, this would be the spot to have lunch or dinner!","Very nice buffet has lots of sushi options as well as other food choices not to mention fresh oysters and shrimp to peel and they also have a hibachi grill  and don't forget dessert!!! 
Service was good very attentive always had my drink filled and as soon as I put my plate aside there was someone ready to grab it, def would come back if I'd live here.","Great food for a great price! A variety of desserts, sushi and seafood! Food tasted fresh and hot. Was skeptical at first due to the location but was very surprised. Will be back!",I went there for lunch. I got food poisoning from their food. I don't know whether it was from the sushi or Chicken. Will never go there again!!,"This restaurant was just a mess.Everyone except for the sushi and hibachi chef we're on their mobile devices.Service was horrible.The food did not have the goods too back it up ,and now for the worst part.At the end I ask ""How do you charge for the kids?""The waiter replies ""WELL HOW OLD ARE YOUR KIDS!""Unacceptable.Completely mean and plain rude.","Wouldn't give them one if it weren't required. Food is l o u s y. Im so disgusted I dont even want to write the review but, it is so so necessary.",434,1
Ichiban Buffet 2,735 N Courtenay Pkwy,2.5,The waiter was pretty nice and the food was good. Especially the green tea ice cream.,"My husband and I went to Cocoa  Beach, FL
 On vcation. We rode around an found this AWESOME  BUFFET.  The food was excellent, bathrooms  nice clean an fresh. The server  were nice an friendly.  The cashier  Judy was very friendly.

Steve and Mamie  Brunswick,  Ga","12/3/2018

So, since LIn's chinese buffet has permanently closed, we weren't that far from our backup chinese buffet, Ichiban's in Merritt Island, FL.  Arrived at around 1:00 pm and was pleasantly surprised at how good the selections on the buffet were.  Everything was fresh and ""HOT"".  Hopefully this will be a nice constant change to what they were before.  While wife and I were eating, we noticed how the kitchen staff were continually bringing out refills to the buffet.  Everything we had was hot and delicious.  Staff was very nice and attentive as they checked up on us often to refill our empty glasses.  They do have a Sushi bar and a mongolian bar, but the food was so good, we got full before we could try them out.  So, another review will be forthcoming when we do try them out.  Loved the food.  Cudo's to all the staff at Ichiban's Buffet.

I hope all the negative reviewers will give this place another try.  If you enjoyed it as much as we did, consider giving another review.

(321) 453-1117","I hesitate to give this place even1 star.  Ichiban should be closed down. I ate there two nights ago and it was the worst meal I have even had.  I should have trusted my instincts to run when I walked in and nobody was in the place.  The food was old, and either hard, or soggy.  None of it was fresh, probably still out from noontime if not left over from the day before. Everything was cold even though there was steam coming from under some of the trays.  The room was okay, the staff was not particularly pleasant, and the Christmas music annoying.  I do want to mention that the grill where you can have them make stir fry for you looked like it was never cleaned.  When my husband saw the built up grease he was praying they didn't scrape any of it into his food.  He was so grossed out he didn't eat it.  It is a nasty place and I was surprised no one in or party didn't get sick.  Avoid, avoid, avoid.","the only reason they got one star is yelp doesn't offer no star. The place was dirty and hot. food they served was one step away from the garbage. Better yet thrown in the garbage. I was afraid for my life. The owner should be ashamed. Health ispectors should shut them down. I felt sorry for the crab legs,  shrimp, and what looked like fish... totally destroyed... the only food that wasn't destroyed was pudding it remains coagulated like a blob and keeps is slimy form for days. co mon man!","On a Saturday night,  one would expect more diners. I should have taken my cue and exited immediately.   Cut to the reasons for one star: chewy rubbery potstickers, food left out on the steam tables
 much too long, more rubbery food like the Krab and cheese dish, and most other dishes...crab legs floating in water so long that I couldn't hardly crack them open to extract the  the overcooked, sodden meat. And that was $5 extra. I talked them into a discount on the crab legs of only $2. I know the restaurant needs a manager experienced in setting up and maintaining buffet, but they will probably fold before that happy day.",31,1

Very good food, I believe it's the best in the area. Very good sushi bar. Also the soup is Emmy. Good service compare to the same category. 
                 .","Lots of food, great hibachi, and great service.   I wish the sushi chef would speak more English though.","AMAZING! Very wide selection of food, very well cooked & flavored as well! I highly recommend you give it a try! We are vacationing from Mass and this blew everything we have up there out of the water they even have a hibachi grill included along with a full sushi bar for you sushi lovers ;).Come for lunch or dinner and surprise your taste buds!!",I always go here but I have to find a new place to eat.  The waiter picking his nails over our food.   NASTY! Very disappointed!,"Rhe sushi chef always keeping an eye on us and when we try ro get some sushi, he always nod his head till i was forced to ask him if what is his problem? I told him and remind him that it's a buffet! Then one time we there for lunxh, it took us an hour to wsit for all the foods to come out. Then we tried the rolls,  we spit it right away. It tastes nasty and told it to the server, she advised us to not to eat those bec. It was reheated from last night's left over, omg it's so eeeweee.... Will never come back to this place again, i wish i could put zero star!","Horrible place. It is dirty. Strike One -- They sat us at a table that had wadded napkins under the table and soy sauce dripped on the table. I asked the host to have someone clean it up but no one seemed to care. Strike Two -- the tempura sushi rolls were cooked off early and left stacked behind the line at room temp. Strike Three -- food was scattered on the buffet line. White rice was empty. Ice cream is scooped by hand by customers where they leave the scoop in the ice cream bucket for the next customer. Considering that no one washed their hands before being seated I can only imagine how contaminated the ice cream must be.

The food was lousy. Egg rolls where soaked and sitting in residual fryer oil. The were bland. The black pepper chicken was okay. It was crispy. Green beans were cooked properly. They were a nice green and had a crunch under tooth. I am not sure how this place has been able to pass a health department inspection based on just the items I listed. Who knows what is going on behind the scenes. We will never be back.",495,1
Ichigo Ichie Buffet,3611 S Orlando Dr,3.0,"Great selection of seafood! Fresh and tasty seafood. The blue crab is delicious as well as all the other seafood such as, jumbo shrimp, squid, steamed salmon, oysters,  and crawfish. The Sushi and hibachi are yummy. The restaurant is always clean and comfortable. The service is always great. The prices are awesome $10.59 for dinner? That's a deal.","Pretty good for a Buffet. This is the best of it's kind in Sanford. Very staff, Good food and for a buffet the sushi is Quality stuff!","This restaurant has been a long time favorite of mine. The family, friends and I have celebrated many get-togethers here and everyone always leaves with a full stomach and a smile on their face. Such a clean establishment, and it has been that way since I first visited 4 years ago. 

Keep it up, you all are doing a fantastic job! 

-Joey from Longwood",Oh heck no after they failed their health inspection I'm definitely not coming back because the food didn't taste all that good and it wasn't that my cup of tea.,While sitting eating our food a cockroach crawled out of the napkin holder and across the table. When I told the waitress they didnt even take the napkin holder off the table or find the roach they just wiped the table and sat someone new in the seat.,"My friend and I ate here for dinner.  Saturday night 6.30p.m.  chicken and broccoli was old and dried up. After round 2 my friend went to get the pepper shrimp and the lady was cleaning the counter with her dirty rag and had a piece of shrimp in the rag and put it back in the food on the Buffett table. I left the waitress a 2.00 tip, and complained to the owner.  I still had to pay for one dinner.  I'm. Still Hungary. I'm done eating in this establishment.",76,1
Izziban Sushi And Korean BBQ,5310 E Colonial Dr,3.5,"BOMB DOT COM!!!! I'm telling you guys, this place opens til 2am, all you can eat, sushi, Shaba shaba, and Korean bbq. I'm so surprised with the service and interior design too. I'd definitely recommend going here. Price is pretty good too, but if you're hungry, where else would you go?? 5stars!!!",Great lunch specials and amazing korean BBQ. The one on E colonial also has great scenery and is open late. Jist wish you could sit with friends when they get Korean bbq and not yourself.,"This is my go to after hour sushi place. I've been dying to try the Korean BBQ but haven't had the chance yet. The sushi is delicious and very affordable. If you go after 10pm they have AMAZING deals. The staff are always very kind and helpful. I would highly recommend this place, especially if you're having late night cravings since they are open until 2am. They have plenty of seating and accommodations are made for large parties, they also have 2 bars you can sit at and an additional sushi bar you can sit at. Affordable and delicious.","I have visited Izziban for lunch once a week for at least 6 months. It quickly became one of my favorites as one of their servers, Kevin, made each experience amazing and although the food was never consistent, his amazing attention and friendliness was and therefore we kept coming back. 

Unfortunately yesterday was probably my last time at this place. I took a party of 18 to celebrate my birthday and even though the place was empty, as it typically is, and we had 2 servers (Kevin was not there unfortunately) me and 2 of my friends ended up not eating lunch as our meal never made it out of the kitchen. The staff that attended our table was unapologetic when we asked to cancel our meals as the other 15 on the table had finished. They simply brought the rest of them their bill and walked away. 

Several of us complained and yet the manager never came over to apologize and/or try to make amends. This is how you lose business. An 18 top that will never ever come back to this subpar place of business.

If I could, I would give them 0 stars. Save yourself the hassle and go to a quality restaurant in the area like Seito in Baldwin Park if you are looking to eat sushi.","Walked in around midnight to get some sushi and I was told they don't have any ""open tables"" but they literally had 18 tables open.  Just sounded like they don't like the business or they just don't care about the customers. In fact the lady wanted us to wait for 30 minutes for a table to open? I'm very surprised to hear this and wonder what the owner thinks is happening at this restaurant.","Izziban used to be one of my favorite places to go & eat kbbq, but after being hospitalized from getting food poisoning I will no longer be a returning customer. I am deeply disappointed because of their poor sanitary condition and hygiene practices of their employees. This needs to be addressed because this is both a health and safety concern.

King Buffet,2157 E Semoran Blvd,2.5,First time here driving through town and I wish I lived closer!  This buffet has the best Chinese food I have ever had at a buffet. Sushi was spectacular!!  Very impressed and I'll be looking for one closer to my home now.,Sometimes you go to a place and they have that salmon where you be like 'is this real?' And then you question it for days to follow when it feels like there's a squirrel fighting a python in your belly. Not this place. Their salmon is real. 100% real.,Its all all you can eat so come ready to eat and it have a little something for everyone plus the price is not bad and you spend under $10 for each person depending on the time.  Eat as much as you can because you pay for it.,"The only reason is not because of there food is the pressure to tip ""heavy"" why? I firmly believe in tipping but not 35% on a buffet,  They all ask ""keep the change keep the change"" with two dinning its comes to 35% tip for a buffet with a 20 dollar bill per person or one dining with a ten dollar bill  35% tip for a buffet  and if you say no I want the change they tell you that YOU must tip now has happened many many times will not go back, If you go I suggest have exact change you WILL be pressured for a heavy tip and then they stand there and wait for one most aggressive restaurant I have ever been to and not a isolated time has happened to me 8 times will not go back only because of that different servers too,  Never experienced that any where else ever",Where is a health inspector when you need one? You have a one in ten chance of finding a hot entree on the steam table. How exactly is that even possible? Darn if I know but King buffet has figured it out. The carpet should have been replaced about ten years ago and the overall environment gets a top rating in the Yuck category. I went here because it boasts of being the #1 in the Apopka area...number one what needs more explanation!,"Why ? Breakdown -Food is good, Price is good, HOWEVER every time I go the servers demand a tip if using a credit card- Demand a tip using cash not in a nice way but very demanding every time I don't know why though? Always, most say ""you must tip me"" I hate to hear this as I guess there are a lot of cheap people that don't tip? I guess but its being told several times during the meal is not pleasant for me so I will skip this place, And its not a isolated time been going on for a over a year, It a shame they have to ask constantly almost feel bad for servers,  Not for me",30,1
Koywan Hibachi Buffet,"945 W State Rd 436, Ste 1179",3.0,"Whenever we rarely stop by at the Longwood area for some reason, this buffet is usually our ""to go to"" over in this area. It's clear that the sushi and the grill are excellent, the sushi was delicious and the grill over the top! No exaggeration, it's family friendly and pretty clean. There was a variety of all sorts of yummy Asian foods.   
    
    I loved how I could pick what I wanted, and I had a huge selection of stuff to take, like rice, noodles, chicken, beef, mushrooms, corn, and plenty of others. I could even pick sauces, which was really cool. 
   
    The yummy sushi (especially the cream cheese filled rolls) and the great grill was excellent. The service was great as well. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the buffet.",Very modest lunch prices. Fresh fish in the sushi bar. Hibachi bar was tasty and fast. Good variety expected at an Asian buffet.,"I have seen a lot of Chinese buffets in my day, obviously. This, however, is one of the best that I have encountered. 

The sushi section is phenomenal. The nigiri gets a whole sections with like five different types, and the rolls section has a ton of different options that are actually built uniquely and don't just rely on drenching them in different sauces like other buffets do. They also have two or three different varieties of deep fried sushi rolls that actually taste differently from each other. This whole area is brilliant.

The hibachi section is pretty standard. They have two chefs working for them, which shows their volume needs do to their popularity. When I went this most recent time, though, they did not have eggs to put in my fried rice, which was a little bit of a bummer, but I got over it very quickly. 

They have a super awesome looking salad section. Very complete. They have a few soups to choose from. Everything else their is pretty satisfying. I love their peanut chicken, the cream cheese rangoons are on point, and the Korean short ribs they had were probably the best bite I put in my mouth the whole time. There was nothing I would say that I would avoid. It's just your preference if you want to eat a baby octopus or not. 

Overall, if you have ever liked a Chinese buffet ever, come here. You will not be disappointed. I know I wasn't, and this was only the lunch time buffet that I encountered.

PS, they offer a student discount, so don't forget your student ID!","$38 for 2 adults (with tax & tip) was WAY TOO MUCH for this experience! This is a Chinese buffet with hibachi and sushi, so don't expect high quality here.  My husband and I are not typically buffet fans but we've eaten here with family a couple years ago and enjoyed it so we thought we'd give it another try.

To start on a positive note, the hostess was quick to greet us and seated us promptly on a slow Tuesday night. She immediately took our drink order and told us to enjoy the buffet. 

Our first plates were piled high with the typical fried assortment of Chinese buffet staples (sweet & sour chicken, general Tso's chicken, veggies, egg rolls, etc.). All selections were warm, but definitely not hot by any stretch of the word.  

My husband filled up on another plate piled high with an assortment of fried fixins while I headed to the hibachi grill.  The fried food was greasy and warmish (as expected). The hibachi was MUCH better than the buffet food. The items are selected by you from small bar of choices and placed on the counter for the cook. This particular cook seemed to resent having to be there (with his Bluetooth device around his neck and stained white-ish shirt) as he grunted to place the plate on the counter and asked which sauce to apply. The food was cooked quickly and very hot. Good taste but minimal flavor. 

Cleanliness: The restrooms were deplorable. I've seen gas station bathrooms in better shape! Three of the four stalls were disgusting and paper towels lay across the floor. The handicap stall was clean enough to use but the sink was literally hanging off the wall!!! 

The floors throughout the restaurant looked as though they had not been cleaned in years. The walls were splashed with dirt/liquids. The ceiling was covered in stains and dust. The lighting was terrible (probably for good reason, if you saw the details before sitting down you probably wouldn't)!

Upon paying entirely too much for 2 plates each, my husband and I felt disgustingly full and bloated. 

Needless to say, we won't be back.",The hot food was cold.the sushi was warm. I had to send my drink back because it had a film of grease on it. The teppen yaki told me how to pick my food then made my food wrong. Then when I made my concerns know I was told that I did it at the wrong time after the meal not during. Which I would have had I even seen a waitress to even refill my drink. I wish I could give less than one star.,"Food was ok, but not worth the price. Hostess was argumentative.  Not everyone likes seafood.  Every chicken dish was right next to some type of seafood so almost everything tasted like fish.  I'll never waste my money here again.",292,1
La China Blue,3749 S Kirkman Rd,3.5,Really good buffet for the price. 6.99 for the lunch buffet and the food is really good. They have a wide variety of Asian food including Chinese cuisines and also sushi. . The food was very good and again very affordable and the staff was very nice and friendly. I would recommend going here and I will be stopping by again if I'm ever on this side of town again for a quick lunch spot.,I live in the area and this is the first time I have tried this restaurant. It wont be the last. What a deal!! The place is very clean and the food is very good. I would recommend this buffett above any in town.,"Let's get the obvious out of the way. This new, bright-eyed crew is taking over a well-worn spot in a not great stretch by the high school, and it's not my favorite place to find parking (the spots it has are limited and shares with the grocery plaza). I want this place to succeed SO BAD! The first time I ordered take out, and when I walked in it was this spotless, bright delicious looking buffet. The ladies at the counter are so nice and accommodating. I almost just started digging in- it all looked delicious. Also, check-in! they have a coupon for the dining room. The second time we got delivery and it was prompt, perfect and (I know this is small but it bugs me when it's missing) he had a pen and writing surface for me to complete my bill. The hot and sour soup is the best I've had in years and the Mongolian beef had mushrooms that are HUGE. We'll definitely be ordering again, and I can't wait to try the buffet.

UPDATE: had the buffet. Get on it people!",This place is horrible. Food is awful and they do not restock the items. Do not go here. Very disappointed that I relied on the yelp reviews. Definitely would never come back,"Possibly the worst place I have been to in Orlando.  Went in for the lunch buffet and should have spent my money at RaceTrac.  When I walked in I was the only one in the restaurant, I should have known then to turn around and walk out.

Everything on the buffet was cold and many of the condiments were empty, how does that happen since they have only been open an hour.

I would not recommend this place to my WORST enemy.

SAVE YOUR MONEY DONT GO HERE!!!","If you are looking for a great Chinese restaurant this is not best place for you. If you like bland, unseasoned food then this is for you! I ordered chicken and broccoli lunch platter the chicken and vegetables came separate from the sauce and the sauce was bland and unseasoned! The rice was soggy as well as the French fries. I will never be ordering from here again :)",39,1
La Cita Country Club,777 Country Club Dr,3.0,"Went to dinner there last night. We didn't have a reservation, but they took us in anyway. The meals are Awesome! I had a chicken salad, my hubby had the roasted chicken, and Gwen had the ""Boil"". Mom did a soup and dessert. We were impressed.","Now open to the public, we eat here often. Last night was ""PRIME RIB NITE.""  Mmmmm.  We had other options, & the salmon was very good. The PRIME RIB was Exceptional!!!","When I'm in town I usually get one or two meals here. The food is above par and the service is always kind and friendly (sometimes they're a bit overwhelmed with the crowd).  Dad had the chicken tenders (love 'em!), I had the hamburger (delicious but a tad too greasy) - still that's not really a complaint because some like that a lot.  They have GREAT fries!!","We went last night for the prime rib 
At 6:45 we were told they were out of it except very well done ! Very disappointing! When we were ready to leave the manager came out of the kitchen with some mor prime rib ! After we were told no more ?! Won't go back !waste of money !",Overpriced food and mediocre service.  Sure that works when you are in a restaurant with incredible ambiance in a wonderful location.  But this is a run down country club with what amounts to a sports bar.  And then every item seems to come with some sort of up charge.  Save your money for somewhere worthwhile.   This isn't it!,"What a lousy experience. I came in ready for a good meal. I sat at the bar (there were 3 others sitting there as well). I was completely ignored by 3 different people. My wife joined me and we waited. At this point I was curious to see if anyone would bother to see if we wanted something. 20 minutes later my wife started waving at people. They finally stopped cleaning glasses to ask in a rather indifferent manner if we wanted something. At that point I said no. We stayed for a while so we could listen to the karaoke. 
Got to laugh. After 56 minutes people started asking if we wanted something.  From what I understand there was a table for 6 that sat until one person got up and asked a waitress for help. 
There were three servers for 12 tables and us poor people at the bar. Guess those glasses were really important. We weren't. 
I guess the review on another site was correct. The owners are using it as a write off.",6,1
Lai Lai Chinese Cuisine & Sushi Bar,"7400 Southland Blvd, Ste 116",4.0,"I have been coming here since I was in high school. I've been to many places for sushi, but this remains my absolute favorite! The fish and ingredients they use are SO fresh. I've never had a bad meal here. I also enjoy their Chinese buffet every once in awhile (to mix it up). As for sushi, my favorite rolls are their volcano, Philadelphia, and tempura roll. Also, their kimchi is the BEST. I also appreciate that it's a family owned/ran business. My husband and I enjoy seeing those familiar faces greet us as we enter! We don't get out that way as often as we used to since we moved, but we still make the trip on the days I'm craving it like crazy, like today! Still as good as ever!","You can beat this buffet for the price. I went for the sushi and that was as delicious as can be. It's a simply menu, done right. Will definitely be one of my go to food spots.",Ask for the Gil roll. Its not on the menu but its a Ping speciality and its awesome!!,"Compared to the other reviews this must have been an off day. This was my first time visiting and I went at 12:15 on a Friday. Based on the reviews here, I decided on the buffet. It was terrible. The worst buffet  ever. It was right in the middle of the lunch rush and every single item on my plate was either cold or was very tough from sitting under the lamps for so long. Even when they brought out ""fresh"" sesame chicken, it was still cold like it had been sitting around in the kitchen for a bit. I was really wanting to like this place because it is so convenient to work. At least, with tax it was only $6.15. If you have another choice for lunch, go there and skip this place.","Horrible horrible horrible. Extremely dried out food and they wouldn't cook anything fresh in there buffet.
Way over priced for what you get. Stay Away.","Came here for lunch today for the buffet.  Like a couple of the Yelp Reviews the buffet portion is not good at all.  Maybe the dinner and sushi portion is better.  No variety what so ever, taste wasn't bad just wish it had more vegetable/meat choices besides.  Im sorry I won't be coming back.",68,1
Latitude & Longitude,8701 World Center Drive,4.0,This is my third time visiting the Marriott and my 12th time eating breakfast here. They have a huge variety of food to eat and great staff and cooks. Enjoy!,"Delicious food. Their steaks are outstanding, and I recommend trying their banana dessert! 
Great wine list, great service, highly recommend.",We enjoyed Latitude & Longitude so much that we came back two night's in a row. The Cheddar Poppers bread is wonderful way to start the meal. We were happy to learn that we could get a side salad with our meals. I enjoyed the Grouper and my daughter loved the Bacon Mac & Cheese.,"I have never had food poisoning before, but thanks to Latitude & Logitude, now I have. I ate lunch here on 5.1.18 while at the hotel for a conference. I wound up missing most of the conference as a result. I called the restaurant and spoke to a manager and received assurances someone would call back to follow up (and at least my money would be refunded!). Didn't happen. Will never return to this property.","Very sad and disappointing! we are here for the weekend for a tournament. Our entire team is staying at this hotel. We arrived late and decided to have dinner at this restaurant. Today also happens to be my daughter's birthday  The food  was horrible. As per our servers recommendations I ordered the grouper which was raw. My daughter ordered filet mignon, for the cost of the entree I can believe that it did even have a sprig if parsley served with it. We also ordered fries - the ketchup served with it was a paste dried up and smelled funky. This restaurant is an embarrassment - Marriott should review the food and service , this is not what we expect as guests of this property. The server was polite.","Overpriced and the food wasn't very good. The steak that cost $45 was tough. The crab cake appetizer was good and meaty, but there was shell in it. The Brussels Sprouts had ham in them, and that was not noted on the menu. They were nasty. I don't like ham, but can you imagine someone trying to keep Kosher or Halal and not being notified of this? It was an extra $6 .  It was not included in the inflated price of the steak. Also, the DINNER ROLLS cost extra. Now, I know that this is an upmarket restaurant and that the food would be pricey, but I almost broke a tooth on the steak. It should have at least been as good as the Ponderosa. 
The waiter was nice. He prevented this review from hitting rock bottom.",29,1
Lechonera Latina,3806 Curry Ford Rd,3.0,"Ordered via UberEats. Food arrived hot and well packaged. Ordered the family style meal with chicken and another with pork. They have several styles of rice, I went with the rice and beans and the rice with pigeon peas. Both were delicious. The pork was so moist and tender. The chicken was well seasoned. Both trays had some maduros inside, which was not expected! 
The fried potatoes had some minced beef inside. Very tasty- smooth like mashed potatoes. 
The cheese and guava pastries were good. The guava I wished for more filling. The cheese ones were perfect. I would recommend them more than the guava. 
Order did not have any missing items. We were very pleased. This fed more than ten people. I would order from here again.","I've been to serval locations in Orlando and this place is a value! My family of 8 for under $30. The portions of rice and meat are huge and all delicious. The pernil, arroz con gandules, yuca, maduras, and chicken is great. My only complaint is that it's counter service so the food may sit under a heat lamp for a while and can dry. I've learned to go earlier to prevent this. The flan and tres leches our well for after!","Omg. They give you huge portions!  First time here.  Got the ox tails with rice and fried plantains.  I just love ox tails. Theirs were pretty tasty but I thought they could have been cooked more as they were not exactly falling off the bone.  The rice had pieces of sausage in it and was good as were the fried plantains.  

My friends got different items so I got to try the blood sausage.  Loved it.  You could taste all the seasoning and it had a great texture.  The fried chicharron was GREAT. Porky fried fat goodness 

Will certainly be back to try something else.",A woman here charged me extra for my dessert. Women become miserable and envious and proceed to do things like this.

Mandolin's,2900 Parkway Blvd,2.5,Im staying at the Radisson hotel and we had dinner at Mandolins and the food was great. i had the Cuban half roasted chicken with plantains and rice. My husband had the grilled salmon and roasted vegetables. We also had calamari for an appetizer.,The lunch was great and the staff was super kind. Plus it is right on the Grand Resort's premises.,"I was staying at Radisson for my Disney Vacation and happened to pass by this restaurant with my boyfriend for Valentine's Day. We figured it was quite empty and to just stop by here since we knew every other place would be packed. To our surprise, we had a pleasant experience and good food! Our server was excellent and was very attentive. We ordered the NY strip and the Ribeye and for $30 12 oz steaks, I was thoroughly impressed with how well it tasted. I would definitely recommend eating here if you're staying at the Radisson as it totally beats the hotel Sports Lounge and Diner and will only cost a bit more than a meal there!",The decor of this restaurant is nice however the chef should probably offer a new Mediterranean menu. This restaurant is certainly not busy for obvious reasons however the one server working in the good-sized restaurant is pleasant. The pork belly is far from a delicious dish and the berry crumble taste like a freeze-dried biscuit with jelly on it.,"The service in this place is horrendous and the food underwhelming. Leave the hotel, go elsewhere, it'll be worth it.  I usually don't leave bad reviews like this, but it was so awful I needed to let others know so they can avoid this place at all costs.

We arrived at 6 PM on a Wednesday in April and we were the only people in the entire restaurant. Our waiter came over immediately, brought our drink order, and then promptly left for 15 minutes. Since he was gone, I had to get up, grab the pitcher of water and fill my families drinks up.

When we got our food, my steak that I ordered medium rare was cooked a little past medium. When I showed it to the waiter, he started telling me that it looked medium rare to him. There was no juice at all.  Because he was being a real jerk about it and I didn't feel like having a steak with spit, I didn't send it back. It was tough and rubbery.

He then came back to check on the table and only addressed my wife and asked ""How does the woman like her food?""

While trying to decide how much to tip him, I got the check and found out I didn't have to worry about it, because they added 18% to the check for a party of 2 already.

No wonder he was such a crappy server, he gets a tip no matter what.","Horrid food and painfully slow service.  My grilled grouper was so dry and tasteless, it was like eating a loofah sponge.  The mound of brown mashed potatoes that came with the fish was flavorless and had the consistency of paste.  My husband's grilled shrimp was completely overcooked, as if it had first been baked or left under a heat lamp for about 15 minutes, which was highly feasible in light of the incredibly slow service! We were the only patrons in the restaurant (now we know why), and it took a full 90 minutes to complete our 1-course meal.  Unacceptable.  This place needs new management in a bad way!",12,1
Mei Asian China Buffet,"8255 International Dr, Ste 126",2.0,"I love this place, it is definity first choice to have a meal, I have  been here several times, the food is always good, as well as excellence service. the price is reasonable, it is so worth it.

With a 14.95 price , this is totally worth it!",Great food! Everyrhing was Hot and Fresh! Ate soooo much! Had to chill before we left...,Don't bother.   Unless you want about 6 or so types of fish there is no point going.  Nasty. Save your money and your stomach.,"I've been going to this restaurant on-and-off now for for the last 9 or so years. It's never been the greatest place, but the lunch price was good and the food was pretty decent. About 2 weeks ago I took my parents there for lunch, like I've done many times before. This visit however was my last one to this restaurant. There were MANY things wrong.

All food on the 2 hot lines of the buffet we cold. I mean actually cold, not even room temperature. I understand that some of the foods had been brought out a little earlier, but there is NO reason that anything on the hot line should be cold or room temperature. I can't help but think of all the foodborne illnesses that were festering on those lines.

Another issue that we can across was the cleanliness as a whole. The floors were filthy and slippery. The table had visible food pieces left behind and was very sticky. The plates and bowls from the ""clean"" stack were also sticky and some had visible food pieces on them.

At this point, I'd say the County Health Inspector needs to shut this place down for the good of the many tourists that end up there for lunch or dinner. It's definitely not worth the money you pay, especially when the potential for food poisoning is the highest I've ever seen at ANY restaurant I've ever eaten at.",This whole thing. Bad. Old food. Chicken was soggy. Salmon undercooked. No ice cream names. No chop sticks. It just sucked.,139,1
Mikado Japanese Seafood Buffet,"851 S State Rd 434, Ste 1130-1170",4.0,"The service was great, the food was great, it's tasty and has a good variety, bonus points for having my favorite dish chicken Katsu just put it on a bed of rice with some tempura sauce perfection. All of the food is delicious, the squid, seaweed everything.","Went here today for lunch and was very impressed! Everything seemed so fresh and well made, even the sushi was totally delicious! (Which definitely isnt the case with most other buffets.) Definitely coming back again soon!!","I've always opted for the take-out sushi option, so I can't speak to the inside seating. What I can tell you is that this is the highest quality sushi buffet in the Altamonte area. There are easily 20 or more different types of rolls and they are all unique and delicious. The takeout pricing per piece is very affordable and I can often score about 50 pieces of sushi for about $40.","I been there today, 25.95 per person which is over priced ! The taste was not real Japanese food and the rice was over cook ,hard to bite like fried rice!",Went with several different friends and family members at different times.  Everything seemed to be ok. They complained the food was cold and not really fresh. The sushi wasn't rolled tight enough. I found the tempura not crispy enough to not have breading fall off. I really enjoyed my first time thete. My son said the rice was cheap tasting in the sushi. His wife knows rice well as she is korean. Service is good. I will not be returning to this restaurant again due to over all lack of quality of food and everyone I've brought complaining about different things.,"The first time I came here, foods were great. I did suggest this restaurant to my friends and family. But now after a few times I came, foods are really bad, poor limited selection and they charge my daughter $7.99 because they told her 3 feet 5. But she isn't.
$24 per person is not worthy anymore.

Minnie's Silver Screen Dine,351 S Studio Dr,3.5,"This is a wonderful experience. 

It is an all you can eat buffet. As you are eating your food the characters are walking around to take photos and sign autographs for the kids. 

This place gave me the warm and fuzzies. The characters are really good with the people they interact with.

My niece had a blast. 

The food was really good as well; much better than i expected it to be.","Reservations are a must ! And you must respect the time of your reservation! 
Otherwise the place and the service is awesome! After a few days of snaking and food on the go this self service restaurant surprised us ! Very tasty food a good selection from starters to desserts! If you have a dining plan you get some drinks included. 


And the kids will enjoy the company of some well known Disney characters we stayed until the closing time and we've got a surprise from the staff and their friends ! Thank you so much!",So this dinner buffet was delicious but was not as special as some of our other Disney dining experiences. It's definitely worth it for the characters though. Cocktails were just ok.

Do yourself a favor and ask what the cost is before you sit down.","This place was probably my least favorite place in terms of food.  The food was a buffet for lunch and was just ok. I wish they had healthier options but they only had salads.  Having said that, it was nice that the characters came around throughout the meal and our waitress was very nice.  They provided us some tickets to one of the evening events which allowed us to skip the lines.  When we went for lunch it was pretty empty but filled up around 1:30/2 when we were leaving.

Moghul Indian Cuisine,401 N Semoran Blvd,4.0,"Moghul was amazing!  I have a small (okay huge) Indian food addiction, so I'm always looking for great places around Orlando.   Apparently, they have some of the most authentic Punjab-style food in town, and they didn't disappoint.  Their portions were huge, the menu was fairly priced, and service was fast.  I'm usually a chicken tikka masala or vindaloo person, but I heard their lamb dishes and traditional curry were especially good, so we ordered their lamb curry and vegetarian appetizer.  The sauce was everything a curry should be, and the lamb was cooked extremely well.  The best part of all though is that they will actually give you ""Indian hot"" if you ask for it when many restaurants do not.  I will definitely be going back.","SHUKRIA!

We were so excited when we found the Kohrinoor folks had opened a place closer.  Went there tonight and had vegetable samosas to start things off.  They were -- we think -- the BEST we've ever had.  TRULY!  Then we were on to butter chicken (our FAVE!), dal makhani, sag paneer and onion kulcha.  IT WAS AWESOME!  We long ago found that the Bukahara restaurant we ate at in Dehli in 2000 and had AMAZING dal makhani is the same place where a chef at Kohrinoor works (ed).  It is the BEST since we left.  And tonight's dinner . . . . . AWESOME!  And soooo close to home!  We LUV this place and felt like Moghuls the whole time!  :-))))))

SHUKRIA BIG TIME!",Delicious food and super attentive and friendly staff! The vegetarian options are so good. We will definitely be back.,"I am going to preface this review by saying that I am giving this place 1 star only because the chef actually came out and asked me what was wrong with his food. Otherwise I would give it -1 star. LOL.

I feel for anyone starting a new restaurant, its a lot of work and so much learning to do, that being said.... if you don't know what your wait time is when someone comes and asks you how long is the wait for a table is then you have to learn HOW to run a restaurant before you open one.

Our experience was some what of a funny dream, here is how it went. We walked up to the hostess who had a nice smile on her face and said ""table for 2 please"". She goes ""nothing is available except this one table (which was right in front of the door)"" so I say ""I don't want to sit here and don't mind waiting, how long is your wait"".  She says "" I don't know, it could be anything""... I could not believe what I was hearing LOL. Then she goes ""I have to write your name down"" (like it was very depressing that she had to do that), I said ""sure go for it"". She adds ""It will be at least 35 minutes"" , I am like ""thats fine, thank you"". Then 4 minutes later she goes ""The table is ready!"" LOL.

Anyway I thought that was mildly amusing and said as long as the food is good who cares, I can always do take out from here. Then 20 minutes pass and no one comes to take our order. So my poor husband had to go ask the hostess again to come over,  I said ""Is anyone going to come take our order"", She goes ""No one came to take your order yet? Its been so long no?"" I am like in my mind of course (DUH!!!). 

The she drags the waitress to our table and says ""Here she is!"". Our waitress looked so depressed, didn't smile, didn't introduce herself, just took down our order down and left. She did say ""sorry about the wait"" which was nice. 

The food then arrived.. rather quickly.... so we thought its looking better now.... maybe this is a positive sign. BOY were we wrong... the Sheesh kebab was totally without any flavor... but edible so we said, maybe this is not their signature dish. Lets order something that was highly rated like the lamb vindaloo. Omg... the vindaloo was horrible, I refused to eat it, the spices were not roasted so the raw smell was all over, it was horrendous. 

The only items that were edible were: rice, the roti and chicken malai kebab. Notice I said edible! Then in the end we just wanted to get out of the place so we struggled to get someone to get our check since no one had come to our table to fill our drinks or even to ask how we were doing. Again my poor husband reluctantly went and got the hostess since our waitress was no where to be found.

When the hostess noticed we are not packing anything and didnt eat anything she said ""you didnt like it?"".. I said it was alright trying to be polite.. but she asked again and I said .. it was not good.

Then out comes the chef asking me what was wrong, and since he asked, I told him politely the spices were not roasted. To which he goes,  I am the chef, I think you are reacting to the vinegar and started telling me how long it takes to cook lamb and that he will give a tour of the kitchen. I told him listen I am Indian and I cook everyday the same thing and I know what was wrong. To which he goes what did you order LOL... if he didn't realize by now what we were talking about, I knew that was trouble. He then went away and came back and said ""I tasted it and I talked to the other chef that prepared your meal and he confessed that he had not roasted the spices. If it was me I would have roasted the spices, but my other chef admitted he didnt do it"". Then he asks me again"" What did you order?"" LOL LOL LOL..If he tasted it and could not tell what it was ... we got some serious problems!!!  I then said ""thanks for taking it off our check."" This is why I give them 1 star... but overall food was totally not what Indian food should taste like. If you want to taste good Indian food please go to memories of India 2 in lake mary to get an idea of what service and Indian food should taste like.. then go back here and you will notice the difference.

I also have to add that as we were going through our somewhat alice in wonderland type experience other tables were complaining that no one had come taken their order in 40 minutes. 

Again, I feel for anyone starting a new restaurant, lot of kinks to work out. But if you don't roast your spices, and can't recognize your food by tasting it, and don't know your wait times... you should re-consider your line of business and at least try to hire someone that can help you understand the basics.  I will definitely NOT go here again and in fact this restaurant inspired me to join Yelp and let people know that this is NOT good Indian food, and lets not even go into the ""FINE"" in their name. Thank you for reading.","One of the worst Indian restaurants I've ever been to. The food was so bland, very few options at the buffet and service was terrible. We asked for a bowl and they told us to fill 5 tiny sauce cups. Seriously?!

My answer each time was no this food is too tough to eat. All I got was three blank stares.

My suggestion:  stick to the pizza and I expect you'll be pleased!","I don't really know about giving 5 stars because I'm afraid I'll discredit a 5 star rating in the future... but sincerely, this place was amazing and we just happened to stumble into it.

I can't wait to go there for there pancit.","Hard to find Filipino's places around Orlando for breakfast. This was the only one that had prepared hots foods to order.

We loved the sweet chicken with the garlic rice. The sinigang with pork wasn't that flavorful and the pork was really dried out and chewy. The milk fish tasted old and the longnise was so so.

The staff was very friendly and fun to be with.","Serving food everyday from breakfast to dinner. Buffet on weekends. Balik-bayan boxes, phone cards, money remittance, filipino groceries and more! Good costumer service. Parking sometimes can be a hassle specially during lunch time this place can get very busy so plan of arriving before rush hours.","Pandesal is thumbs up!!! 

Stopped off here for Filipino Breakfast, I had tapsilog (beef tapa, egg, rice, & tomato) - - it was good, but only one egg & the tapa was frozen.  Up north they normally give two eggs, not one - - but that's ok.  My wife had fish which enjoyed.

We also tried their Pandesal (Filipino roll) & it was very good - - we even took 3 bags home to Connecticut with us.

There are only a few seats (about 12).  Dinner does get crowded, mostly take out.

They have a little market - - I mean little.

Enjoy!!!",14,1
Plaza Garden Restaurant,9000 International Dr,3.5,"We stayed at Rosen Inn and had both breakfast buffet and dinner buffet at Plaza Garden Restaurant. Both were very good. Food was fresh, hot, well seasoned, and delicious. It was more than expected from a restaurant inside an inn. $9 for breakfast and $15  for lunch, it's a good choice for some lazy last day staying at the inn. Plus the service was excellent too.","Regular buffet.. the usual choices, toast, eggs, bacon, pancake etc.. Service was fine not much was needed since it's a buffet. Great breakfast deal for kids under 9 to eat free with adult buffet purchase. I ate and my kid stuffed his face for just $9 not including tip and taxes!! May go back for lunch or dinner!!","A really good amount of choices at the breakfast and dinner buffet! Clean and friendly, reasonably priced too! Different daily choices keep it fresh! We eat here often even in this area crowded with restaurants!","Horrible food. Dry turkey, dry pork, flavorless sides. Terrible service. Don't spend your money. There are better places to go.","I wanted to wait until I had the breakfast buffet before I wrote anything. I had the dinner last night and wasn't impressed but breakfast was much better. Night and day different.
The dinner has a a pretty good selection of eats but most were overcooked. The pork loin..dry. The Beef Stroganoff (if that's what it was, was overcooked..the mixed veggies, same story. I didn't even try the fish. They DO have a senior discount for over 55 so the meal was $11. The servers are quite nice, very accommodating.
Same for the breakfast crew. And the breakfast was a marked improvement. The pancakes were good, sausage and bacon pretty good, they had yogurt, cereals, grits, etal. And the coffee was quite strong.
But they don't have a senior rate for breakfast. Even so, it was $9 with tax. I feel good now, ready to go walking a few miles now.","Regular buffet.. the usual choices, toast, eggs, bacon, pancake etc.. Service was fine not much was needed since it's a buffet.

Ponderosa Steakhouse,7598 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy,3.5,Absolutely Perfect. Food was excellent service even better. Couldn't ask for a better establishment.  If there was an option for 10 stars I would give it.,"Was very pleasantly surprised by the service, steak, and buffet!! I hadn't been to a ponderosa in years (since there aren't many left) but honestly this is probably the best one I have ever been too! The steak was cooked just as I ordered and it tasted so good that it did not need steak sauce!! The buffet had plenty of items and a well stocked salad bar. Everything was very fresh!! We had a couple of servers check up on us multiple times and they made for a very great experience!! We are passholders to universal so we will definitely be back!!","Wow! Great inexpensive food and super clean.  For 45 minutes we were the only people in the restaurant.  This is the ONLY Ponderosa in the State of Florida... had to stop in.  Everyone was super nice and helpful.  There is ""enough"" of a selection of food to have a decent meal.  Salad bar and hot bar was fresh, neat and clean.  I'll be heading back.","I sat down with my daughter after getting a plate from the buffet and we started eating by then my steak arrived, when a man behind my table tells me and points out the big size cockroach walking down the wall straight to my table. He tells the waiter and the waiter grabbed a napkin and kills it right in front of me. Needless to say I was grossed out and lost my appetite. I saw the manager avoiding the situation and he did not came to the table to apologize for the situation until after like 10 minutes, he said sorry that was it. I was in shock on how they handled everything like nothing happened. I was the one who asked for a refund because I was not eating  anything else from that restaurant. When they came back with my receipt they only refunded my plate not the whole check. I've never been grossed out by any restaurant until now. I am very angry and disappointed on how they treated me.","Horrible buffet.  Dry chicken, dry hard meat loaf, ice cold pasta with sauce that tasted like canned tomato paste. Yuck!","First off, I give it zero stars. This automated system forces you to give it a star rating before one can proceed. The worst dinner we ever had. The staff dressed in poor attire. Kids were running all around the place, like it was a playground.  The food was terrible. The hot items on the buffet bar were cold. The steak was salted down. The lighting in the place was awful and it could use a paintjob.",21,1
Rosen Inn Lake Buena Vista,8442 Palm Pkwy,2.5,"We seriously only paid $52/night, thanksgiving week for a clean, spacious,  and recently remodeled room, 15 minutes from Disney. The staff were all friendly and helpful. For what we paid, we really lucked out. I was a little worried, but very happy (and surprised) by this hotel. If the weather would've been warmer, we could've taken advantage of the little water park area, which also looked nice for the kids.","Excellent hotel for the price! Room was clean and smelled fresh. I did not use pool, no gym that I know of, and buffet didn't look fresh, but I wasn't there during the busy season. These are the only downsides that I noticed but was overall a great place to stay and I would highly recommend! I liked that the location was gated and had a gate attendant at all hours, it felt very safe.","Perfect hotel if you are just going to the parks and needing a place to crash. Clean , comfortable. We have kids and it was perfect. Wifi is slow but we all need to disconnect anyway.  Family vacation means spending time with one another not surfing the net.","There was more than one issue that has made our stay here very frustrating. We were visiting from Las Vegas on our honeymoon and decided upon this hotel for many reasons, one in particular, is that it was a WDW good neighbor hotel. With that being said, we think that the customer service should be held to a higher standard, and this hotel lacks any type of customer service. I have received better customer service in a motel 6! We called on a Sunday the 10th of November to see if we would be able to check in early. They said, no problem, just call in the morning to see if your room is ready. Monday the 11th we had called, and asked if we could check in early, especially since we are traveling with a pet. They said, no problem, your room is ready. We get to the hotel, the front desk staff was very unfriendly. We were not even greeted with a simple hello. Then they go on to inform me that the room was not available. I explain that I had already spoken to someone and they said it was. She said, that since we were traveling with a pet, they had to put us in a different building and no rooms were ready yet. I was not going to accept this for a solution. What were we supposed to do, sit in the lobby for 3 hours until the 4 pm check in time! Then she goes in the back, talks to someone and miraculously a room is all of a sudden available. This has set our tone for what is supposed to be a happy vacation off to a very sour note. The next day I go to the front desk to pick up our breakfast vouchers since they said they were not ready yesterday and ask for a new room key since I had left mine in the room. I give them my I.D. they make me a new card. I go all the way back to the hotel room, and THE KEY DOES NOT WORK! Now I am beyond frustrated and I am furious! I walk all the way back to the front desk, tell them my key does not work, and they say they can't give me a new card with out my I.D. (which I left in the car) and they saw me less than five minutes ago! At this time I ask to speak with a manager. They go to get her, I am waiting for over five minutes and she is still a no show. At this point, I am just so frustrated and want to get on with my day. This will be the last time I will ever stay at this hotel.  Hopefully my review will help others from making the mistake that I did and book this hotel.","Upon arriving to our room (1331), I turned on the lamp and my 3 year old son immediately pointed out ants on the desk. I was surprised to see about 25 ants crawling all over the desk and part of the dresser. Since they were small black ants, we just got rid of them and made sure there weren't any on the beds.
Later that night, I found 16 black pubic hairs on the  rim of the tub and inside the bath tub. I moved the bath mat to the side to get it out of the way and there were 3-4 more hairs underneath that. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!! I ran the shower for 10 mins just trying to get all the hairs out of the tub. I immediately felt like that room had not been cleaned. I called front desk to verify and explained what I just saw and the only thing she told me, ""Yes, of course it's been cleaned.""  That's it. She had no explanation for the pubic hairs nor did she offer some comfort or even a different room.  
It was hard to sleep peacefully in that room the next 2 days since I felt like maybe there were other disgusting things that have yet to be discovered. This is not a quality hotel. 
The front desk & housekeeping need better training... also room 1331 should be sprayed with insecticide.","My fiance and I stayed here for race weekend and expected it to be not high quality and even expected the room to look old etc.  We were not even surprised when we saw the shower with dirt and hair in it.  (i cleaned before showering).   I just laughed it off an said to myself ok next time I will pay the extra to get a nicer hotel.  

What did shock me was the following.  I was checked in and prepaid until Monday.  My IPAD was taken from the room.  When I called security they said they did not have it and was questioned if I even brought one.  It wasn't until I called the police and told them about the tracking information on it that it was magically found.  I got the craziest run around by Security for an explanation and was never contacted the following day.  The services was DISGUSTING to say the least.  We received 3 different stories on how my IPAD from the room I was checked into ended up across property in the security office.  I called the GM after returning home to tell her what had happened and she promised to call me back. I told her I really did not want to speak to security again since my issue was with them. The GM set a poor example because she had security call me back at 10 something at night to my home number.  The GM nor the Deputy never called me to follow up like promised.  I guess it was too much for me to expect a level of costumer service from upper management.

Hotel is a disgrace.  (Please note the check in staff was very friendly).",145,1
Saffron Indian Cuisine 1,7724 W Sand Lake Rd,4.5,"We visited this restaurant during our trip to Orlando. We had high expectations after going through various good reviews and this place met those expectations. In fact, we visited this place three times during our 7 day trip in Orlando. 

Everything that we ordered was simply superb and had authentic Indian taste. We ordered Shahi Paneer, Dal makhni, Chicken tikka masala, Chicken chettinad, Chicken biryani and Veg biryani. Both the biryanis were pretty good but not excellent though. Another good thing was that you could ask for different spice levels for each entrée/main course. I think they had 4 spice levels - No spice, mild, spicy and then Indian spicy. Another plus point, they offer a bowl of rice with every main course dish.

The place is quite small but always full (at least when we visited). Ambience is not that great but I think its taste what matters the most. Service was quick, our food was served is less than 15mins.

Some reviewers have complained about the quality/taste with the buffet lunch but since we always visited the place for dinner, we cannot comment about the buffet food.

We will highly recommend this place to everyone. Keep up the good work guys!","Came here while on vacation in Orlando. Man oh man was that some tasty chicken! Just the right amount of spicy, the rice was fantastic with pretty good portion size. It was a little on the pricier side, but nothing outrageous for Indian food. If you're in the area, I would definitely recommend it.","The BEST indian restaurant in Florida. I've tried every single indian restaurant in south florida, and if Icould I  would drive to Orlando each month to go to Saffron! Incredible flavors and food!","I will never order delivery through Grub Hub. Delivery said 40-50 minutes. After an hour and 15 minutes passed, I called the restaurant and was told it's been ready, I have to pick it up!  I'm from out of town wasn't planning on getting an Uber tonight. I was then told a driver might pick it up. I'm sure it will be cold!  He also had no idea that I already paid online because he told me I had to pay when I pick it up.  I'm so upset about this right now because I've been waiting in the hotel lobby for over an hour!! What a waste of my night.","We are new to Orlando. Worst experience at this restaurant.  It was so disrespectful to us. Agreed, they were busy, but we stood at the greeters area for 12 minutes. No one bothered to even say hi or ask us to wait. I mentioned the same to the manager and left the place. They didn't care much though. Went to cedars next door, which was heaven. My request to management, please respect people first.","We drove in from out of town and drove here because of the good reviews and the fact that it was advertised as OPEN at 2:50 pm. We came out of our way to try it out. We walk in, and were immediately told they were closed for lunch at 2:30.

There were people still eating on the tables.

I said, ""you know you're advertising as open on yelp, right?""

""Sorry.""

I asked if they could still feed us and they said no.

If I was the owner I would have come up and apologized profusely and perhaps done or said something to motivate us to come back, maybe for dinner.

Bad management, especially for first time customers. To me, that is as important as the quality of the food.",870,1
Saffron Indian Cuisine 2,"16745 Cagan Crossings Blvd, Ste 103@104",3.5,"This Indian food is really great. It is truly a gem. The restaurant is very clean and the buffet is very clean. The food is fresh and seems like it's very well cooked. All the food was very tasty. With the buffet you also get unlimited bread to go with your meals. Staff was wonderful and made us felt great. I'm glad we stumbled upon this and the staff recommended the buffet. Will come again! I am not one to eat Indian food, but after I left I craved more!","The new Indian Restaurant at Cagan Crossings, Saffron, is fantastic!
You can order from the menu at any time of the day (they're open from 11:00am to 11:30pm), and while the price might be slightly higher than the other options around Cagan Crossings, it runs in lieu with other Indian restaurants (from $10 to $20 for a meal).
The quality of the food is great, though. Their meats are seasoned deliciously, and their naan is the best I've had (try the pesto naan). You can even ask to make your meal spicier, and spicier it was!

The buffet, while short in options (usually 3 meat options, 3-4 veggie options like lentils, squash, or seasoned potatoes, rice, and a dessert option), is still the best one I've had. The buffet is $12.99 per person, and is more than worth it when you take into account the quality of the food for what you're paying. You also get unlimited naan at the buffet!

I've been here around 7 times, and every time it's been a delight to eat here. 
That being said, on 2 occasions service was a miss. Once, it got so busy they ran out of rice for 10 minutes or so, and another time, service was a little slow. The staff is very friendly, so if you need something make sure to let them now. 

If you're in the mood for the best quality buffet for the admission price, or would like some late Indian dinner, make sure to give Saffron at Cagan Crossings a chance.","My wife hates Indian, and my son is ""meh"" on Indian. However, both absolutely loved this place for dinner. For me it was wonderful. It is to Indian food what Sarah's across the street is to Greek (of course unlike Sarah's they don't have the best fried chicken in the world).  I think that maybe some who wrote negative reviews ate the lunch buffet. I have a feeling that they have difficulty translating their astounding quality and freshness into a buffet. It was $55.00 for all three of us, and we ordered several appetizers. My only criticism might be that I could have eaten more, but that was because it was so tasty.",I was really looking forward to trying the food. It was the worst meal I ever had. The chicken was dry and hard to eat. Couldn't stomach eating the whole meal. Will not waste my money on this again.,Supposed to open at 11:30. It is now noon and they still aren't open. We have an appointment at 1. They just lost business.,"I just came here about 2 weeks ago. I was very excited to hear there was an Indian restaurant moving into Cagan's crossing. And then I heard it was a Saffron and couldn't wait till they opened their doors. The Saffron Indian Cuisine on Sand Lake Rd is incredible! We've had lunches from them catered at work and their food has always been top notch, sadly the same cannot be said about this place. I'm not even sure if they're affiliated with each other but this location should not be mentioned in the same sentence as the original Saffron restaurant.

Now with that being said, they've only been open for a few weeks so you have to expect some growing pains. However, here's what caused me pains on my first visit.

Price - Ok. If you've eaten at Indian restaurants then you already know some can be very expensive and overpriced. This is definitely one of those places. $20 for their lunch buffet. Waaaaayyyyy too much, especially considering the following.

Food - BELOW AVERAGE. Ok, below average is being nice. Some of the items were closer to bad then below average. Lack of variety on the buffet. Butter chicken, a couple veg dishes, no paneer dishes, just a lack of choices. Then I ordered a soda and got a can of soda. I didn't look at how much the soda was, but if you're charging $20 for a soda and a lunch buffet, I would expect it to be out of a soda machine not a can.

Service - I gotta give the girl who served me a B. I was greeted upon entering and she was polite, courteous, and respectful. At one point I went back to get my last plate and my last one was still on the table until I cashed out so I had 2 plates now on the table. I can't fault her though because on one of my trips to the buffet, I saw her scrubbing dishes in the back telling me she's a one woman army. 

I'll wait awhile then give this place another chance to see if anything changes. However, they are not off to a good start.",70,1
Savannah Bar and Grille,3011 Maingate Ln,2.5,We were treated like royalty by staff which was attentive even though we were there for breakfast buffet with our hotel stay at Radisson Park Inn. Food was typical for a buffet.,"Besides it being convenient, the food was actually good except for the burgers. There could have been ore options for burger toppings. Staff was really nice and attentive. Overall I really liked it.","We stayed at the park inn and instead of leaving to get some dinner, we decided to eat here. 

They have an option of eating from the buffet for $13.xx or just ordering from the menu. We just ordered menu food because the buffet food looked like it had just been sitting out there for a while and looked like they cooked whatever they had in their fridge. It was a very weird and random assortment. + salad bar. 

Anyways, we ordered the queso dip. Asked if it was yellow or white cheese. Waitress said ""both? It's like a pale yellow."" Lol. We ordered it. You get a pretty large portion with a lot of chips. The chips, I don't prefer, but it wasn't bad. 

I ordered the deluxe burger. It's just a regular burger w cheese, lettuce and tomato. You get the choice between American, cheddar, Swiss and provolone cheese. It came with a side of fries. Nothing special but it was good enough. 

My son ordered the cheeseburger meal. No complaints. 

My boyfriend ordered the chicken quesadillas as his meal. It was delicious! He said probably the best quesadillas he's ever eaten. Comes w salsa and sour cream. 


My expectations weren't high because of prior reviews but it's not a place to ""beware."" Our server was very sweet and attentive. 

Good service. Good food. Solid 4 stars.","Me and my wife were staying in the hotel and tried the dinner buffet. To start my list of complaints is will say that the lettuce for the salads had not been washed. The burgers were rubbery. The chicken and vegetables was almost raw in spots and overcooked in others, a difficult feat to manage given that the pieces were hockey puck sized. The fried plantain had the taste and consistency of card board. The ranch was actually blue cheese, and the Italian dressing was desert levels of sweet. The only positives were that the pre made cheesecake had been opened and placed at the bar and the fries were decent. Also the management was sorry that we had a poor experience and offered us a steep discount.",Bad food ! Go somewhere else I'm not kidding. Do not eat here for breakfast at least ....! Not even for convenience walk some where or eat at the the gas station down the street it has better food even.  And and they automatically add a tip for  lazy service.,"I'd give half a star if I could.  Just horrible.  

We were seated by the manager...at a table that wasn't fully cleaned. Spoons on the floor, someone had taken all of the jelly packets out of the caddy and stacked them in some weird little design.  Okay... We opted for the buffet that we thought was included with our stay at the Radisson.  It wasn't.  Okay...  Boyfriend went up to get food while I waited for someone to come take our drink orders, as the manager said would happen. No one came for a good 10 minutes. We ordered drinks, coffee & orange juice. Juice not included in the buffet price.  Okay.  

Food on the buffet was old & crusty. Biscuits were like hockey pucks and gravy was heavily over salted.  The waffle machine was down most of the time we were there but the manager asked someone to take care of it and they got it up & running. Those were good afterward. I was able to find some good bacon in the pile of gelatinous fat that was presented. My coffee was brought & I asked for cream. She gave me some and left. I then noticed that the cup was dirty and there were a lot of floaties in it. I waited for her to come back to ask for more...she never did.  I tried to get her attention multiple times afterward with no luck She didn't have any other tables that I could tell. My boyfriend got cereal and when he came back to eat it there was no spoon in the provided silverware. There were none located with the buffet either. The only one I saw was on the floor when we arrived. (Note: other people seemed to have an attentive waitress so maybe they aren't all bad)  I was finally able to get the managers attention and she came over; we asked for the check. 

When we paid we discovered why she decided she didn't need to come back to the table. Gratuity is included. 

Never again, even if it was free. There's a Denny's, Perkins & Ihop all nearby. There's a McDonalds close.  Just don't.",9,1
SeaWorld Orlando,7007 SeaWorld Dr,3.5,"My review is definitely going to be a skewed review as my company shutdown the whole park for a few hours. The experience was amazing.

Hello,
I am a retired military veteran and have had trouble with the website in purchasing my tickets.  So i called customer service.  The first person couldn't help me, her name was Jewels, she then transferred me to her supervisor Juanita.  Juanita was the rudest, nastiest person i've ever talked to.  She kept wanting to get off the call, and then proceeded to hang up on me.  I asked her not to hang up, and she did anyway.  So i called back.  I ended up getting a hold of her again (although the young lady before her, who answered my call, was almost as rude as Juanita), Juanita would not give me her supervisor/bosses name, she said ""i am the highest person in charge"", and i asked her why did she hang up on me?  Guess what?  She hung up on me again!  Please let me find out who her boss is, and what you all plan on doing about this HUGE problem in customer relations.","Getting into the park is a nightmare! No organization or people to control the crowd. Staff upon entry seemed miserable. Dirty and smelly bathrooms. I recommend leaving the park well before it closes. Again, no organization. We were stuck like a herd of cattle for over an hour.","I'd like to point out that the only reason my family and i decided to go to SeaWorld yesterday was because tickets were cheaper then Universals and Disney. Now i know why they're cheaper. 

This place is awful. 

We walked in the park and my wife and kid wanted to go do the dolphin feeding but myself and my nephew wanted to do the rides. Well my nephew and i did every ride the park had to offer twice before my wife and kid finished with their dolphin feeding if that tells you how little there is to do there. Seriously, there's 4 rides. 

I get that ""Oh its all about the animals and working to teach everyone about these wonderful creatures that need our care and love."" Sure, which is why you drag them out and parade them around for the amusement of fat, small minded tourists. 

Kids constantly banging on the glass, Moms shoving lights in the eyes of barracudas, flash photography mixed with children and adults smacking the fish tanks screaming for the animals to ""Do a trick!"" Not one time did i see any employee stop any of these people to ""educate"" them that they were acting like shitheads and stressing out the animals. 

After being herded through the shark tunnel like i was on a cattle car, having my personal space violated constantly. having kids punch me in the leg in line because ""they're bored"" paying $60 for a spoonful of reheated Chinese food at the cafe, we decide to leave but we stop at the dolphin nursery first.

This started to cheer me up a bit watching the mother dolphins play with their young. Until some fucking teenager next to me starts screaming at them. ""DO A FLIP! DO A FLIP! DO A FLIP! STUPID DOLPHIN DO A FLIP!"" Their were plenty of employees around that were well in ear shot of this kid who could of told him to shut his mouth in any polite cooperate friendly way they could of, but instead they just sat there looking at their watches. 

This place is a shit hole. The animals are being abused. The rides suck. There is no redeeming quality here. Sea World needs to be shut down.",1116,1

She replied that they close at 3pm.  ""Wait a second.  You're telling me that I have to wait for 2 hours to get a chance to be seated and then you're going to close the restaurant before the 2 hours is over?""  She didn't really have a response to that except to repeat that it was a 2 hour wait.  SO ridiculous!  We went across the street to Fuddruckers where we were munching on burgers and fries within 15 minutes.","I wish I could give this restaurant zero stars, but unfortunately Yelp won't let me. I am drafting this review on the toilet (for the second time this evening), as Texas de Brazil gave me food poisoning. This place is a total rip off. Not only is their food ridiculously over-salted, so you'll drink more and eat less, but it tastes even worse coming back up! Most of the beef that came by was overcooked as well. I wish I would've taken my $50 and gone to a nice steakhouse where I could've had the exact cut of meat I wanted, cooked the way I wanted without so much salt!","Visited this location on a Saturday on January this year. We did not make reservation.
We walked in and the receptionist told us it would be a 30 minutes wait. After we waited for an hour, we asked the same receptionist when we would have our table. She said she did not know ,but first let her take care of all the customers who had done reservation. We told her it was too cold here and  if they could adjust the Ac temperature higher. She told us for keeping the meat's quality, they had to keep the room temperature low....Funny, then you should build your restaurant into a big walk in cooer  for customers to sit in and you will be able to keep your meat under 41F to pass the health inspection..

hahaha...please consult with your local health department.

We didn't calculate how long we waited further, yet after a long wait, we finally were directed to the second roll of table to their open kitchen. it took another 20 minutes for the waiter to come here to explain us the green color and red color thing.. and another 10 more minutes for the waiter to offer us the chicken with bacon,the parmesan pork,   the salty sausage and the garlic something..the chicken with bacon and the parmesan pork , the salty sausage and the garlic something... : I told them please gave me some meat, the restaurant is called Churrasqueria  buffet ,which means all you can eat charcoal grilled steak. It seemed like they did not understand my English. They kept on offering me the mutton, which I have serious allergy with. I told them I wanted a piece of beef and that was it and if  after I had my beef, I would leave and  would not bother them anymore.  After another 10 minutes,the server gave me two small pieces of Rib-eye steak that tasted like a piece of chalk. When the manager passed by, I told him about my whole experience. He told me the server said I wanted well done beef and that was why it came out dry like that. I told him I am a food professional , the way they cook on a large  skewer, they could slice a piece from outer part of the meat and that will be well done.  And after that .the situation did not get better and they did not offer us anything anymore. I talked to the manager who looked like an Asian (actually ,they had two managers on duty, one was caucasian, the other one was Asian. The Asian look manager was the one walking around the tables and talked to clients. The Caucasian was standing by the POS,acting like he had nothing to do with all the problems of the operation.) I told him the service was poor and too slow. He said the restaurant was not like McDonald's,,,

Funny, if you compare your restaurant to McDonald's.. I don't know what to tell you.
With the price we all paid for this meal ,we could buy 100 McDonald's burgers and played a burger war... I decided to leave the money and walk out...

The Caucasian manager saw us leaving in unhappy way, he pretent he was walking to the kitchen..

What kind of  chain restaurant is this, managers being lacking of food service knowledge, poorly trained cooks and servers, irresponsible management... too salty food, very slow service,stupid explanations from staffs and manager ,cheap meat combination in relation the price....supervisors and COO of this chain, you need to look at yourself seriously  or you will be down very soon...",848,1
The Crystal Palace,1365 W Monorail Way,3.5,"Great food, great service excellent character interaction!  Kip was the best waiter ever!",I really liked that the characters come and walk around so we can take pictures. I went with my brother and my wife for her birthdy. I feel it was a bit over priced for the food...more than red lobster or cheesecake factory especially for the quality of the food. But it is disney after all so i guess its ok for a special occasion.,"Love it!  We go here for breakfast every time we take a trip to Disney World.

The food is served buffet style and is absolutely delicious!  There are plenty of options and it is always well stocked.  There is a build your own omelette station too for those wanting that.  

The building is beautiful.  It has a old time feel to it.  It is bright and welcoming.  It is also immaculately clean.

We've never had bad service here.

The characters are Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Eeyore, and Piglet.  They come to each table for autographs and pictures.

This is a must do for us.","They sat us late and then preceded to rush us through our meal and had characters skip our table for other tables, and when asked why they did that Bob the character handler said ""well you have been here for 45 minutes"" when in fact we were actually sat 20 mins after our reservation, also the manager on duty Jon was of no help in fact he blames us for why the characters skipped our table, they only came back when we chased down Bob, he also stated that ""he had no control over what bob and the characters do"" he also provided no solution to our problem, one of the worst Disney experiences ever and some of the rudest cast members I have ever encountered","Hands down this was the worst buffet that I have ever been to. The food was just plain gross and for the money they charged Disney should be ashamed. My kids wanted to go to a character dinner so we though that this would be fun. The characters were so overwhelmed with the kids that it took us around 90 minutes to see them all. It is not the characters fault just Disney for packing in both sides of the restaurant. I have been to other character meals before and they were all smaller venues.

They should make some Disney execs eat there so that they can experience how crappy the food is and how long it takes to see all the characters. If anyone of them says that the food is good, they are lying.

Save your money and go somewhere else.","If this had an option to give zero stars it would. I eat, sleep and breathe everything Disney and this is the worst customer service we ever received at WDW resort. The staff was actually rude and my 830 reservation decided to magically appear into a 930 according to the cast member. Now I would have been fine with the hour wait if I hadn't checked in since 800 waiting patiently. But its all about the way you present yourself. Worse yet for a character buffet. It was a let down.  Chef Mickeys and Tusker House was far better.",575,1
The Garden Gallery,1950 Magnolia Palm,3.5,"Great buffet at shades of green resort on Disney World Resort  property. In the morning the buffet consists of made to order omelets and pancakes in the shape of Mickey Mouse that you can choose to add blueberries. Chocolate chips, coconut, pecans, or almonds. They also have on the buffet fresh fruit yogurts granola ham bacon sausage frittatas breakfast potatoes breakfast pizza and a toaster station where you can toast bagels bread and English muffins. At dinner each night is a different theme. One night was carnival night with hamburger hot dogs cotton candy popcorn and make your own candy apple. They even had healthier options if you found these options unsuitable. On other night they had a wing bar with 7 sauces. A pasta night with a make you own pasta station. An Asian night with make your own stir fry , and a Mexican night with make your own nachos and quesadilla. On all these night they also offered a baked potato bar and and extensive salad bar and two kinds of soup which also changed nightly. For desert they had a nice assortment of cookies, pies, and cakes and they even had a gluten free brownie on most night for those with gluten sensitivity. I thought this buffet was far superior to any buffet at Disney and for a fraction of the price. Also if you do the shade of green meal plan called the Red white and blue salute or something like that is even a better deal. If you still can't find something on the buffet that you like then you are just plain picky. I almost forgot there is also a kids buffet are with Mac and cheese, chicken nuggets, fresh fruit, and chocolate chip and sugar cookies for dessert.","We started each morning off here before heading into the parks. There were so many choices at the buffet! My 7-year-old son is allergic to peanuts and tree nuts, so he is generally very nervous about buffets when he cannot read ingredients. The staff was very helpful and the chef came out to talk to us about what my son could and could not have. You cannot beat the price and they do a very good job of getting people in and out without making you feel rushed. For those who have not visited in a while, it has been renovated and is beautiful! We did not go for dinner, but heard great things!",Service has been great & Alvin makes the best omelets. Breakfast buffet is reasonably priced.,"The dinner buffet is fairly inexpensive compared to Disney buffets, but I guess you get what you pay for. The food isn't that great. We went on Monday when it's Mexican food. The taco meat was way too salty. Even the brownies weren't very good. I tasted my granddaughter's mac & cheese since she pushed her plate away w/o eating it. I could see why. It had no flavor at all. I didn't even want to eat it.

Plus, there's not a lot to it. You could get tacos, quesadillas, or nachos...all using the same taco meat, cheese, and toppings. Then beef or chicken fajitas and jambalaya (which was strange to see since jambalaya isn't a Mexican food. Dessert was vanilla pudding, lemon Jello, cookies, brownies, or pecan pie.

The meal ended with me going into a panic because I had specifically asked before being seated if they accepted the Military Star Card. I was told they did, only to find out that, no, they don't. That was the only credit card I'd taken since that was the only one I should have needed. Luckily, my daughter was there and could pay.

This is definitely one I won't be returning to.","It's cheap and that is all it has going for it.

The food was very much just ...eh. The bacon looked like it had been drizzled in grease for a topping.  The selection was just ok.  My dad compared the food to what you get on a submarine. Definitely don't think that was a compliment. Plus the children's buffet was ridiculous.  Churros and tater tots. Hopefully you aren't trying to teach your children good eating habits because this place won't offer you anything.

Also, the wait staff was pretty poor. Our waitress was slow and forgot to get us an orange juice we ordered.  No biggie it happens, but when we reminded her we wanted one she still didn't get us one.  We eventually got it at the end of the meal after we told her for the third time.  Though that last time she tried to say we never asked for it.  

Pay more elsewhere and eat better.","Great for kids, otherwise it will remind you of eating at a Perkins.  Almost everything is cooked well beyond recommended safe temperatures and times, and it is reflected in the taste and texture of the food.

But sometimes you just can't put a price on convenience when you have been slogging it around in Disney with a 105-degree​ heat index and early or late Magic Hours.

It is what it is, but I recommend the sports bar on site.  Better food.",21,1
The Knife - Lake Buena Vista,12501 State Rd 535,3.0,We visited from Texas and absolutely love it! You have to try the vacio and provoleta. Our waitress was from Honduras and like an idiot forgot to ask her name. She was super sweet and very attentive. I am from Argentina and loved it. Thank you,"Amazing food amazing service  the meats are so good and I love that its self service. The salad bar was great and varied. Loved it, great date place and they are in groupon.","Carnes excelente, atencion muy buena, ambiente adecuado y familiar.Puedo destacar al leer algunos comentarios que muchas personas opinan sin conocimientos.Destaco la atencion sin dejar de lado el perfecto sabor de las carnes.Si estoy en acuerdo que se pueden mejorar muchas cosas pero no ecepto en lo personal 2 estrellas.Recomiendo que vallan a The Knife con una actitud de disfrutar y aprender de nuestra cocina.Como Argentino disfruto cada comida como si fuera en mi propia tierra.Les recomiendo y que disfruten de un buen vino ( postales del fin del mundo ) con una buena costilla ancha","This.restaurant.BLOWS! Bad quality meats, I really disliked the set-up, and I really hated waiting 10 minutes in line for meat. The rice pudding was good (desserts not included). Also, I got a free glass of wine for checking in via Yelp. One of the guys cooking the meats is super cute. I don't understand what the hype about this restaurant is, ugh. Definitely not worth the $33 I spent here. I think that the only reason this place may stay open is because of the location. Good luck.",This place was horrible there food has no flavor but it's different and you get to experience what a argentine steak house is like.,I would choose Nelore or Texas de Brazil over this place. I bought a Groupon for this restaurant hoping it would be a great experience....It was not. It was not busy at all since it was a Tuesday evening. It took over 30 min just to get the check. They take your phone away in order to scan the barcode on the manager's phone. I don't know why they can't have the manager come to the table. The salad bar was not great at all and I only at the sliced cheese. Will not be returning nor will be recommending this restaurant.,473,1
Tony's Brazilian Grill,5159 International Dr,4.0,"We loved this steak house in Orlando. Large and delicious salad bar. Brazilian style, we love the picanha, pao de queijo, etc... can't wait to go back! Delicious and priced right!","This restaurant is located inside what I like to call little Rio. Nestled around shopping malls and Brazilian Bakeries Tony's is walking distance across the Premium outlet mall. Once I walked in, the attentive staff welcomed us. The host, her name tag said Bia seated us close to the Buffett and gave us a few pointers. The food choices were excellent fresh and the Brazilian Beers were delicious. I am looking forward towards my next visit.","Best Brazilian food in town, staff are very nice and the selection is fantastic.
Very clean place. I highly recommend.",This is the worse food I have ever tasted! If I could give it negative 5 stars I would. The reviews are so misleading and the food items are not what you expect them to be. Disappointing.,I'm an American Gringo and I been involved in the Brazilian People and culture for over 20 years my wife is careoca.  I called the restaurant before we went there and asked what was included in the buffet she stated everything I asked about pacana and she said no that's 8.00 more I asked about Brazilian sausage and she said yes included ! Well when we arrived there was no Brazilian sausage o had to get the manager to ask why I was told yes so he went in the back and brought some to are table it was old cold and dried the buffet was horriable to say the least ! I have had Brazilian pizza before and the was disgusting pizza I ever had we never finished are food my wife was embarrassed because she thought this was a good Brazilian restaurant and it sucked to top it off when we paid the women at the register added 5 dollars  for a tip onto our bill and said is it ok I paid 40 dollars for garbage never Again sorry Tony but you are one Brazilian who only cares about the Mighty Dollar and nothing else Chow baby,"Not worth $$$. Didn't even stay. Save your money! I thought it was a joke, their rate was $14.99 per adult and an 11 year old is considered adult price. They were 3 salads, 2-3 rice side orders and 4 meat dishes- that is all!",53,1
Tropical Cabana,1875 Central Florida Pkwy,5.0,"Delicious, fresh, well-priced, and incredibly friendly.  Lunch special is great deal. Try the avocado salad and camerones. SO glad we found this place. Thanks, Yelp!","Great service , owner's son is a big Seattle Seahawks fan.
The good:  shrimp salad (more shrimp than anything), avocado salad, pine apple juice, mango juice, passion fruit juice.  Tilapia

What I would skip : beef dish, and Masai juice",My husband and I have been going here for years. One of the best breakfasts around.  I have never been disappointed here.  Ordered lechon for a family party.  Plenty of food!  Busy at lunch but most people get food to go. Love their soups with the big mutant carrots.,"Don't buy empanadas waste of money they are empty no meat or cheese. Bought 2 pizza empanadas & both of them almost nothing inside. 
Sorry no pictures I thought about doing a review after i throw them away.",I am on a quest to try to find a good Cuban sandwich. Do not go here! Very greasy could not finish it. Will never go back it took 30 min to get my order.,"La comida estaba fría y en extremo grasosa, el personal está como desorientado y es muy costoso para la calidad de la comida no volvería",150,1
U & Me Revolving Hot Pot,12384 S Apopka Vineland Rd,4.0,"An overall great experience! From Peanut the
Robot, staff and the amazing fresh and seasoned broth with numerous options for the best hot pot experience! Can't wait to go back!","I loved this place. The food was fantastic and a fun experience.  Loved the robots except they brought the menu and dishes before we were all at the table so not everyone got the experience.  My only minor complaint was we could not identify everything on the conveyor and the cooking time chart on the wall was so small we couldn't read it. We ended up taking picture of it and enlarging on our phone. Maybe turn the chart into a placemat so everyone has it in front of them.  
Overall I loved the food and the fun experience- would definitely recommend and go back.","Fresh and quality hot pot! I've been to pretty much every hot pot restaurants in Orlando, this is probably one of better ones.
All meats were very fresh and great quality! The mussels and shrimps are huge, and lamb and beef were fresh cut as well. All other seafood were tasted really fresh as well!
The sauce bar had everything we needed, and the counter is constantly cleaned, which is quite lovely during COVID.
Food variety could be a bit better, but don't get me wrong, they are mostly along the lines with other hot pot places in Orlando.
Overall, If I have to compare, I would say they are better than Top Top Hot Pot, similar to Nine Spice, and for sure way better than Hotto Porto. I would definitely go back to this place!","First let me start off by saying this is not a bad review on the food.
 I am writing this  because I feel it's important to let other people know what to expect before choosing this restaurant. I was visiting the Orlando area and based on the reviews and especially the positive comments about their covid precautions...I felt it would be safe enough to go and have dinner.. I am aware everyone's comfort level is different but I wish someone would've pointed out .. the things Im going to comment on because it would have  prevented me from taking an unnecessary trip.  Upon entering I was immediately concerned because... for me and my family,  we felt it was too many people seated in the restaurant. The robot took me to my seat which was cute as stated in many other reviews 
however again despite plexiglass separating each booth ..  my family still did not feel very comfortable because of covid19 .  Also  I was not aware that part of your meal involved a buffet station . One station for the raw meat in a plastic bin. and sauces at the other.  When  I was there , the the thongs that were used to get the food were not clean, raw meat was on them.. The employees were wearing masks... but even with that , my family and I decided to leave. It just felt like a lot was going on and too many people were in the restaurant especially the waiting at buffet station not 6ft apart, it was too much... We did not order food and did not eat so I would not say anything about the food .
 I think the robot is a cute idea but that's it for me.
As you will read many of the reviews are positive , 
but again I just felt the need to point out my experience .. 
Because the reviews made positive comments in regards to covid precautions and safety that the restaurant provided and I felt those comments were  a little misleading 
because I feel that I was definitely mislead.","Made a reservation ahead of time and when arriving noticed the front was completely packed with people waiting for tables. Upon entering it was a huge cluster of people, no social distancing, and an unorganized way to look for people to seat. When seated they ARE NOT following social distancing guidelines and were putting tables back to back with open aired products moving on belts. It appears this place has no safety guidelines and we left immediately disgusted and unsafe.",This place is beyond ridiculous. (The food is not bad according to my friends so this review not based on the food especially since I did not try it out myself) I came here with two friends and my boyfriend for our first time. What was supposed to be a pleasant meal turned into an annoying experience. I'm a picky eater so I decided not to order anything since I just wanted to spend time with my friends and my partner. I kept my mask on to prove to my server and the other employees that I wasn't going to touch anything but our server kept on hovering around the table making sure I didn't grab anything which just made our dining experience stressful. Apart from that my partner wanted to take off the lid from his smoothie but instantly our server came to our table and stopped him from doing it. Additionally they want you to do things in specific ways which is just a little silly to be honest. Our server literally would not stop checking in on us and whenever she stopped by she would constantly be looking at my partner making sure he wouldn't do anything. Also my boyfriend ordered a drink and he wanted me to try it out which I did because I didn't think it would be an issue but that's when the server began to look over us more. Such a silly thing over a sip of a drink which he's paying for. It wasn't like I was eating any of the food (Could be that our server was just too strict or whatever maybe you might have a batter time than us),105,1
Villa de Flora,6000 W Osceola Pkwy,3.5,I have a gluten allergy and the chef Deddie from France was amazing. Got the breakfast buffet. The chef made us special gluten free pancakes and toast. Excellent server Leslie too!,"Amazing dining experience, beautiful atmosphere and top tier personnel. Thanks for an amazing experience Xiomara and Alex this is our new Orlando destination.",If you want to enjoy great food with your loved ones.... bring them here! Ask for Ali... he will give you superb service. Food was fresh.  We went on Mediterranean night and we enjoyed it.  Ambiance was good.  Lots of wait staff ready to assist.  Pasta prepared in front of you just the way you like it.  Pork tenderloin was moist.... pizza very flavorful. Great end to our day!,"Ugh, overpriced hotel food.  When you are stuck at a convention center hotel they got you and you have to eat what is available and pay their high prices.","I've read that this is the best brunch in Orlando...really???   It's awful!  Don't waste your time or money.  My eggs were cold, bacon was drippy, and they ran out of croissants!  I could go on and on...but the only thing good was our server Phillip.   My recommendation is stick to Kekes.","Glorified sizzler-  I was so disappointed. In the quality of the food.  There are 6-7 stations of mediocre food that you will probably not enjoy.  The cost is $40 per person when it should be closer to $10.  My recommendation is leave the hotel and eat anywhere outside of the hotel for lunch. 

WHAT A BAD EXPERIENCE -  After spending $300 to get my family the Vip experience at ice (fantastic) this almost ruined are day",144,1
Whistle Stop Restaurant,2728 Cayman Cir,4.0,"George's Whistle Stop restaurant is a great place to eat and make new friends!  The food is delicious and reasonably priced. Owners and employees are exceptionally friendly. Diners are made to feel welcome by staff and other guests. Great place for lunch or dinner! Entertainment of different types is offered most nights, such as Karaoke, trivia, or DJ music.","What more can you ask for!  The food is excellent, the beer is cold, the waitresses are sweet as carrot cake.  Don't pass up the desserts whatever you do.  The cooks know their stuff and cook up a storm. I love coming here whether it is for a beer or tear up a prime rib that they offer on certain days.  Everybody that works there has the right attitude. Go Brenda and Kathy...we love u.","Found this restaurant on yelp, almost didn't stop when we seen it was a gated community. Glad we did it is open to the public. The food was great and big portions.","What you need to know about this restaurant is that it is IN a golf course that is IN a 55+ community. The ambiance is definitely ""old folks' dining hall"". The food is good and inexpensive but nothing spectacular. You won't stumble across this place but if you're visiting someone in the community it's a decent place to grab a bite to eat or a beer.",Great food and great drinks for an amazing price.  The Whistle Stop Restaurant costs very little and has such a great atmosphere.  Great place for a quick meal any ole night of the week or a first date especially if you are on a budget.,"Well, I wouldn't seek this place out but it's convenient if you live there. The food was okay but nothing to write home about. The service was great and the wait staff was training a new employee and we were fine with that they were friendly. We were happy to see the chef come out and check with each of us to see how the food was. 


The bar seemed to be where the action was at. It looked like there were several beers on tap as well as a full bar. There were plenty of people that appeared to know each other and we're having a good time watching the several TVs. 

Pros: if you live here, super close and you can drive your golf cart.

Cons: for us anyway, not really child friendly with no kids menu. The lighting was harsh florescent lights in the drop ceiling, giving it almost a high school cafeteria feel.",9,1
